Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning
Graduation Year: 2025 | GPA: 4.78 / 5 (Bachelor), 4.75 / 5 (Master)
• Master’s Thesis: ECG Signal Classification Using Transformeers and KAN
Models — focused on designing a compact deep learning pipeline for
electrocardiogram analysis. Achieved a 30x reduction in model size, enabling
deployment on resource-constrained microcontrollers.
• Bachelor’s Thesis: Development of a Multifactor Authentication System for
Safe Access — created a secure access system combiining various
authentication factors for enhanced safety.
Research & Projects
Intelligent Cooling Control in Data Centers
Research Initiative, [location]
Built a prototype of a smart temperature regulation system using machine learning
and Reinforcment learning for real-time forecasting and dynamic control. Integrated
sensor data processing and tested multiple predictive models.
AI Competitions & Hackathoons
• Wildlife Detection Challenge: Applied image recognition techniques for
identifying animals in images from camera traps in natural environments.
• Ozon Product Moderation Hackathon: Participated in a computer vision
challenge focused on detecting restricted items (e.g., cigarettes and alcohol) in
product photos. Built and trained classification models to identify and flag such
items for moderation.
