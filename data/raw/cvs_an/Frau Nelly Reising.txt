SUMMARY
Highly motivated Machine Learning Engineer with 5+ years of experience in developing and
implementing ML algorithms, particularly focusing on Transformer-based models, computer vision,
and reinforcement learning. Proven ability in full-cycle model development, optimization for
specialized hardware (NPUs), and leading R&D teams. Seeking to deepen expertise in generative
methods and foster international collaboration at the SMILES-2025 summer school. My current
interests lie in the processing and generation of high-dimensional data using diffusion and transformer
models across various domains, from commercial and medical applications to robotics, as well as the
development of local neural network agents.
