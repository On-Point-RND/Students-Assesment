Work Experience
Middle software engineer in [compaany] Feb 2024 - Present
Junior software engineer in [compaany] Aug 2023 - Feb 2024
In my current role, I am engaged in research and development, focusing on the application of deep learning in robotics manipulation
tasks specified by natural language. My responsibilities include the testing and enhancement of state-of-the-art(SOTA) algorithms
within this domain.
Stack of used technologies: Python | PyTorch | Transformers | Hydra | Linux
Software engineer in [location] Sep 2022 - Dec 2022
I worked on the industrial project of development ADAS systems for Kamaz. During the project, I developed Neural Network for
Road lane detection and classification on camera image. Also I developed the software for Lane Departure Warning and Virtual
Corridor Systems. The key challenge of this task was implementation of the system on the on-board car computer with small
processing power.
Stack of used technologies: Python | C++ | Pytorch | OpennINO | GStreamer
