ML engineer ([compaany])
Focus: Multimodal Data Pipelines & High-Performance Processing
Project 1: Rail Infrastructure Analytics System
Technologies: Python, PyTorch, SAHI, Docker, Data Annotation Pipelines
Key Contributions:
 Built end-to-end data processing framework for 10k+ multimodal data (visual + spatial
metadata), optimizing dataset quality via automated augmentation and CVAT-based
annotation workflows.
 Designed a two-stage data enrichment pipeline:
 Stage 1: Rule-based preprocessing for rapid anomaly detection (reducing noise by 35%).
 Stage 2: Model-driven semantic segmentation (YOLO), integrated with SAHI for
small-object analysis.
 Deployed models in production using Docker, enabling real-time processing with <100ms
latency.
Project 2: Driver Behavior Analytics Platform
Technologies: Python, Wav2Vec 2.0, Multimodal Data Fusion
Key contributions:
 Deveveloped a multimodal data analysis system combining speech (Wav2Vec) and
visual (YOLO) streams to detect safety-critical events.
 Implemented a real-time alerting module with 92% precision, reducing false positives
via ensemble filtering.
 Engineered a data feedback loop to iteratively improve model accuracy based on edg
device performance metrics.

PROJECTS
Gemini-Powered Data Analysis App (2024)
Technologies: Python, Google Gemini Pro, Streamlit, Data Analysis
Achievement: Built a no-code data analysis tool that democratizes AI for non-technical users,
reducing manual data exploration time by 70% via natural language queries.
Key Contributions:
 Designed an end-to-end pipeline for CSV processing, integrating Gemini Pro to generate
insights (trends, correlations, visualizations) from raw data with 90%+ prompt accuracy.
 Optimized the Streamlit UI for seamless file uploads and real-time Q&A,
achieving <1s
rersponse latency for common queries (e.g., "show sales trends by region").
 Implemented a caching system to handle 10k+ row datasets
DoCUMent Intelligence Platform with RAG (2024)
Technologies: LlamaIndex, Llama, Python, Vector Databases
 Deveoloped a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to parse and index 100+
PDF documents, enabling semantic search and context-aware QA.
 Implemented a multi-document indexing pipeline using LlamaIndex, reducing query
rersponse time by 30% through optimized chunking and metadata tagging.
 Set up a local Llama-based LLM infrastructure for generating rersponses,
achieving 85%
accuracy with full data control.
