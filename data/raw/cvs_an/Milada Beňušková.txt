EDUCATIION:
2019 â€“ 2023: [location] , faculty of Physics and Technology, I. L. Povkh Department of Physics of Nonequilibrium Processes, Metrology and Ecology.
2023: professional development in [location].
2024 till now: [location] , Phystech SchooL of Aerospace Technology, Department of Ocean Thermohydromechanics.

SCIENCE EXPERIENCE:
Bachelor's thesis topic: "Rheological characteristics of non-Newtonian fluids". During my studies in [location], I participated in several conferences and also twice published in the scientific journal of the university.
For 1.5 years I have been working as a research engineer, in [company]. 
Participated in a scientific marine expedition in the Pacific Ocean in the summer of 2023. At the moment, the article with the results of the work has been reviewed and is in print.
Completed an internship, including studies of the Gulf of Finland at the [location] in the summer of 2024.

ML/DL COMPETENCE:
At the moment, the topic of my master's thesis is "Classification of states of destruction of the stratospheric polar vortex." And I plan to solve this problem using ML/DL. ([location])
I started diving into the world of artificial neural networks in September 2024. And now I'm finishing several courses, as well as participating in a hackathon.
I know the most popular types of loss function and methods of its optiomization, I know about regularization, libraries, etc. That is, I am familiar with the minimal base and structuraal parts of ML/DL both from the point of view of mathematics and from the point of view of practice. I have also worked with fully connected, convolutional, recurrent neural networks and autoencoders in practice.

AREAS OF INTEREST:
Climatology, ecology, oceanology and the methods by which they can be studied.
