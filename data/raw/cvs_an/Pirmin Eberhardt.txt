Projects
RNA-Proteiin interaction prediction | torch, optuna, git, VSCode Mar 2023 – Feb 2025
• Developed a best-in-class neural network for predicting RNA interactoome of each particular proteiin
• Built a custom dataset based on available RNA-proteiin databases
• Proposed a method to avoid leakages during train val test splitting of paired data
• Used torch for the main part of the model and torch geometric for processing proteiin structures as graphs
• Developed a python library and published it on GitHub
RNA structure prediction | torch, optuna, git, VSCode Mar 2025 – Present
• Participated in the Stanford RNA 3D folding competition on Kaggle
