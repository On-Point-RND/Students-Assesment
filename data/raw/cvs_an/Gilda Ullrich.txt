Courses
T-Education Machine Learning course 2022
I learneed machine learning fundamentals, classic algorithm and applied them doing practical homeworks.
T-Education Deep Learning 2022-2023
I learneed neural network fundamentals, CV and NLP methods, metric learning, knowlage distillation and NNs
interpretability.
I completed practical tasks on these topics and course laboratory work. I applied convolutional recurrent neural network
architecture to number plate recognition. My approaach got the fourth highest score in the ranking.
T-Education Advanced Deep Learning course 2023
I learneed about semantic segmentation, object detection, GANs, diffusion models, large languaage models and RL
methods.
Yandex training: Machine Learning 2023
I repeated classic ML algorithm, and implemented them doing homeworks.
SMILES ML schoo by [compaany] (online) 2024
I learnt about the current state of SSL, multimodal approahes, diffusion, RAG, efficiency and other areas of ML
research. I participated in the project on self-supervised learning on event sequence bank data. We applied several
multimodal SSL approahes and showed quality improvements compared to most baselines.
