image differencing
Diploma project for bachelor’s degree in Physics at [compaany]. Leveraging diffusion models
for astronomiical image differencing for transient observations and further physical processing: flux
estimation and source detection.
• Embodied Planning with Language Models October 2024 - October 2024
A team project from [compaany] to reproduce the results of articles Voyager, Odyssey for the 2D version
of Minecraft - Craftax. LLama-3.1 with 70b parameters was used as the main LLM. Exploring
different types of planning based on content prompt.

• Diffusion improvements August 2024 - August 2024
Team project at AIRI Summer SchooL 2024 to improve the quality of diffusion model generation.
BasedonarchitecturesfromU-DiT,FiT,andDiTpapers,exploredtthepoosibilityofcombiiningthese
architectures to improve image generation metrics at almost arbitraary resolutions.
• Face Swap Telegram Bot December 2023 - February 2024
Implemented a Telegram bot to swap the user’s face onto an artwork while preserving style. Utilized
classical methods based on user face masking (facial landmarks and meshing) and more advanced
approaches with user face embedding blendiing (SimSwap, e4s, StyleGAN).
Tech stacck: PyTorch, Docker, OpenCV, Pillow, asyncio, FastAPI, SQL
• Photo Correction October 2023 - October 2023
Team project (MVP) in CV from T-Bank: website for photo editing and modification of parts of
an image using masks and user prompts. Employed SOTA models: SAM for masking and SD for
modifications, including inpaintiing mode.
Tech stacck: PyTorch, Flask, FastAPI, Docker, Triton by NVIDIA
• Image Captioning and Diffusion Filters July 2023 - August 2023
Generated image descriptions using neural networks (CLIP Interrogator, BLIP). Modified image
rregions with diffusion models (SDXL1.5).
Tech stacck: pandas, numpy, PyTorch, OpenCV, plotly
