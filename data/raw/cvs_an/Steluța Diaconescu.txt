Projects
Synthetic Speech Detection | Python, torchaudio, datasets May 2024
The project is devoted to the development of a comprehensive fake speech detection system based on neural
network architectures using ASVspoof data. As part of the project, a model based on ResNet and
transformeers was developed, which was trained on ASVspoof19 data and validated on ASVspoof19 and
ASVspoof21 data. The performaance of the model was compared with ResNet18.
Segmentation, Classification of Brain Tumors in MRI Images | Python, PyTorch, PIL, scikit-learn Mar. 2024
The project is devoted to studying the influence of segmentation on the quality of classification of various
types of brain tumors.
Smart Calculator | C, Docker, Makefile, gtest, Bash, GitHub workflow Sep. 2023
The project is dedicated to the development of a service based on a ready-made backend. The basis is the
program code of a calculator operating on the basis of the reverse Polish notation algorithm. The calculator is
launched in a Docker containeer. Created Github Workflow.
