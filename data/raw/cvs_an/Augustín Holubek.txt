Hello! My name is [name] [surname], and I’m a first-year economics student at [location] [university]. I consider myself a highly versatile and inquisitive researcher.
Throughout my school years, I actively participated in olympiads across various disciplines, and to this day, I maintain a keen interest in economics, history, mathematics, linguistics, physics, biology, geography, genetics, chemistry, and medicine. Even in my first year of university, I’ve begun conducting my own research and achieving recognition at conferences. However, I must admit that I’ve always struggled with programming. While I wasn’t a gamer, I did dabble in robotics in elementary school (though it was brief, unsystematic, and rather ad-hoc). Now, I realize the critical importance of catching up in the field of information technology.
After being introduced to the possibilities of applying artificial intelligence, and particularly neural networks, in scientific research during interfaculty courses at [university], I was impressed and inspired by just how powerful a tool they are. Frequently encountering large datasets without the means to properly analyze them, I’ve realized that mastering neural networks would grant me unparalleled freedom – essentially, untie my hands – and allow me to reach a new level in my scientific investigations.
Thanks to my curiosity and genuine interest in various areas of natural, exact, and human sciences, I often find myself drawing unexpected parallels and causal connections between seemingly disparate facts, and frequently formulating interesting hypotheses and theories. Therefore, it’s incredibly important for me to acquire a truly powerful instrument as quickly as possible, to bring the flights of my research imagination to life.
I’m confident that my strong mathematical foundation, acquired during my first year studying economics at [university], will help me overcome any challenges in mastering the material. Furthermore, I’ve already begun self-studying neural networks, exploring their types, structures, and approaches on my own.
Therefore, I now need assistance from professionals. I’m eager to participate in the SMILES 2025 Summer School to gain a systematic, expert-guided approach to studying AI, to immerse myself in an environment of like-minded individuals for exchanging ideas and experiences, and perhaps even to assemble a team of motivated and cohesive individuals for new research.
