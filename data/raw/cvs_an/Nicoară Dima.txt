Working on the development of MERA-benchmark for evaluating capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with focus on Thesis topic: Measuring the impact of knowledge graphs on question answering
two key areas: graphs for question answering
• MERACode-Lead in collaboration between several industry partners to create a coding benchmark for Russian LLMs. Responsible for developing a ITMO University taxonomy of coding tasks and skills, maintaining the codebase, reviewing datasets, and designing evaluation methodology. Aggregated diverse datasets into a unified benchmark.
• MERAMulti-Designed an evaluation algorithm for open-ended generations of multimodal models. Collected and curated the dataset and trained the evaluation system combining classical ML, LLM-as-a-Judge, and semantic similarity techniques.
