ABOUT ME
I design tools for automated machine learning tasks. Developed a solution for time series forecasting that combines graph neural networks with recurrent architectures. Additionally, I published a method for generating time series data with spatial dependencies, aimed at improving forecasting performance. Currently, I am expanding my expertise in natural language processing: studying the theory and architecture of existing open-source models, with the goal of contributing original solutions to the field.

MACHINE LEARNING INTERN
[company] — [location]
Developed neural network models for time series forecasting on both static and dynamic graphs using spatio-temporal graph neural networks (SSTGNNs). Designed architectures combining graph neural networks (for structure-aware embeddings) with recurrent neural networks (for temporal prediction). Conducted a thorough literature review on related approaches; implemented and compared classical and neural forecasting models. Performed experiments with various model architectures and forecasting strategies to assess better performance and generalization.
Tools: Python, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, Git.
Designed the generation method for synthetic time series with spatial dependencies. Implemented the software and conducted testing of the application. Published a research paper based on the results of this work.
