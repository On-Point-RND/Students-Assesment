Experience
ML engineer April 2024 – March 2025
[company], [location]
• Spearheaded development of GPT-based assistant that helps users with recipe suggestions, product recommendations, and basket creation. Fine-tuned the generative model YaGPT using PEFT (Prompt Tuning) and a BERT model for ingredient extraction from generated responses.
• Fine-tuned BERT for product search by brand. Collected synthetic data using GPT for training. After distillation into DSMM, BERT model performance improved (NDCG: 0.44 → 0.72; relevance share: 45% → 78%).
• Trained BERT for offline scoring of complementary products (replacing CatBoost). As a result, AUC increased from 0.89 to 0.96.
• Trained BERT for offline scoring of substitute products, improving NDCG from 0.74 to 0.83 and reducing irrelevant results from 33% to 12%.
• Optimized the ranking CatBoost model by reducing tree count (3000 vs. 10000) and enhancing feature set, eliminating the candidate generation stage and enabling unified scoring.
• Streamlined labeling workflow via [company].Tasks and automated recommendation evaluation using Airflow.
• Developed a universal B2B solution (library) for partner companies and other related products, reducing the time needed to set up a recommendation service and making it ”one-click deployable.”
• Onboarded and mentored an intern in the recommendation team, overseeing their project to enhance Discovery and Diversity.

Projects
Screeplay Craft AI | Python, LLM, RAG, OpenAI API, Mistral API, Chat completion
• Engineered an AI-powered tool to generate scripts for biographical films and series using LLM.
• Utilized the OpenAI and Mistral AI API for script generation, with support for additional APIs planned for future development.
Subway detection assistant | PyTorch, OpenCV, Roboflow, FastAPI, React, Docker
• Built an AI-powered safety monitoring system to detect individuals crossing safety lines on subway platforms.
• Collected and annotated video data from [location] metro stations using Roboflow to train a segmentation model.
• Built a single-page web application for testing, allowing users to upload subway videos and receive annotated outputs.
Social network | Python, Django, React, Redux, Docker, CI/CD
• Designed and deployed a Django-based social network with features such as site authorization, creation of a personal profile, adding friends, synchronized message exchange, and the ability to leave feedback about the site
• Dockerized the application for deployment on a virtual machine.
• Implemented a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
Desktop client-server messenger | C++, Qt, SQLite
• Implemented user authentication, registration, and token-based session management.
• Enabled multi-device login with real-time message synchronization across clients.
• Built persistent message history storage using SQLite for seamless chat continuity.
• Designed fault-tolerant architecture to handle server crashes and restore connections.
• Developed synchronous message editing functionality across connected devices.
