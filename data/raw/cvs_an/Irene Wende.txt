About me
While working in a research lab, I encountered challenges that led to
a period of burnout. This promp ted me to take a long brea k, akin to a
“GAP year” that lasted several years. During this time, I focused on
self-d evelo pment and gained significant hands-on experience in
d evelo pment. I am now feeling better and am fully committed to the
schooL preparing for gra duate schooL, interested in expanding my
know ledge in the field of artificial intelligence.
