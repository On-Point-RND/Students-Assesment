I am a fourth-year student at [company]. During the school and university, most of my time was devoted to studying chemistry and biology, which later helped me win the Russian National Olympiad and be enrolled in the university without exams. However, over time, I have realized that I am much more interested in math and data science, with their precision, logic, and endless possibilities. With great motivation, I am eager to study all aspects of generative and probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and computer vision. My background in life sciences has given me a unique perspective, and I am excited to see how this interdisciplinary approach will shape my future in machine learning and mathematics.
