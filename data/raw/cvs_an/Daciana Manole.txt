Responsibilities and Achievements:
1. CV System Implementation:
Implemented the "CoParking" system (see more here),
which brought significant profiit and recognition to the
company, attracting new clients interested in deploying the
solution at their own parking facilities.
The system included the following key components:
• Real-time parking occupancy visualization using object
detection models.
• Violation recognition through automated detection
mechanisms.
• Vehicle tracking across [location] Airport parking
areas using detection model and algorithm with Kalman
filtering.
• Accident detection based on segmentation models and
depth map analysis.
• Vehicle counting in open parking zones to assess capacity
and traffic flow.
2. LLM Implementaion: Deployed a locally hosted large
language model (LLM) within the company to enhance
internal workflows while ensuring data security and
preventing information leaks.
