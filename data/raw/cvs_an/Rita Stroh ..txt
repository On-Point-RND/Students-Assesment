This numerical and experimental study examines the merging dynamics of two Lamb-Oseen vortices in a viscous incompressible fluid. The merging process progresses through four characteristic stages: mutual rotation, rapid approach, deceleration, and final coalescence. Results show excellent agreement with experimental data at small Reynolds numbers.

Qualifying paper: The expansion of HII region in the thin layer Approximation
This study examines the expansion of ionized regions (HII) around massive stars using a simplified
hydrodynamic model. The research focuses on the transition from rapid initial ionization to subsequent
shock-driven expansion, with analysis confirming that radiation pressure has negligible impact under typical
condiitions. Results show good agreement with classical theoretical solutions.
Wave Formation on the Surface of a Liquid Film
This work investigates nonlinear waves in thin liquid films using spectral Fourier methods. Stability analysis
reveals waves become unstable below critical wavenumber (α < 1). Numerical solutions via Fourier spectral
decomposition coupled with Runge-Kutta integration demonstrate distiinct wave regimes. Results provide
quantitative predictions for wave amplitudes across different α values, with applications in coating processes
and microfluidiics.

Abstract—This paper introduces a method for fully quantizing Super Resolution (SR) networks to 4-bit
precision by leveraging natural image properties. The approach redistributes quantization errors to edge pixels
using differential operators and reconstructs images via a regularized PDE solver.
