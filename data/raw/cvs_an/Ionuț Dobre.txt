Depth Estimation and Semantic Segmentation data generation via Diffusion conditioning with
synthetic ground-truth 2024 – present
This research explores generating realistic data for depth estimation and semantic segmentation
by guiding diffusion models with synthetic ground truth. While synthetic data is highly precise, it
often lacks visual realism. By integrating depth and semantic information as guidance with
lightweight models, the method could enhance realism while preserving the accuracy of synthetic
annotations. The approach shows promise in creating high-quality datasets to improve computer
vision model performance.
Using of ML methods for aberration correction during transcranial sonication with
high-intensity phased arrays 2023 – 2024
Calculation of phases on the phased array via full-wave model modeling requires high-power GPU
and yet stays very time-consuming. Therefore, we could use neural network to predict phases
using 3D acoustic model. Paused due to the lack of computational power.
Comparison of raytracing and diffraction method for correcting aberrations with high-intensity
phased arrays 2022 - present
High-intensity focused ultrasound is currently used in neurosurgery. It requires tight focusing of
phased array transducer. Raytracing method for focusing is fast but not precise enough to use it
outside of small area in the skull center. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to compare the
results of the raytracing method with such for diffraction method at different locations and
correlate those results with the skull properties.
Ray approach for compensating aberrations when focusing ultrasound waves through
skull bones 2020 - 2022
High-intensity focused ultrasound is currently used in neurosurgery. It requires tight focusing of
phased array transducer. Raytracing method was implemented via MATLAB development kit
using highly discretized data smoothing with spatial spectrum filtering and acoustic path
optimization with Nelder-Mead algorithm. Subsequently, sonication was simulated using k-Wave.
