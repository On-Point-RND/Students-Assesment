Academic interests
My current research interests are centered around recommender systems, with an emphasis on sequential recommendation. My publications, including 5 papers at A/A‑tier conferences span various aspects of the recommender systems field, including benchmarking practices, simulation, user response modeling, and sequential recommendations.
I am interested in exploring modern recommender systems and their intersection with large language models (LLMs), generative approaches, and multimodal learning. In the work “Autoregressive Generation Strategies for Top‑K Sequential Recommendations”, I investigate how autoregressive models from NLP can be repurposed for item ranking and generation. I am also highly interested in exploring how architectures and objectives from LLMs can be adapted to improve sequential recommendation and user modeling.
I’m also interested in using multimodal data, such as text, images, and user behavior, to build richer and more adaptive recommendation models, and I have some work in progress on temporal data fusion.
