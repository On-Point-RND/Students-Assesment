[company]
JUNiORQUANTUMMACHiNELEARNiNGRESEARCHER August,2023‑Present
• Developed a Hybrid‑QuantumCycle‑GAN model for small molecule drug design, which outstands its competitors in terms of chemoinformatics metrics, such as QED score, up to 30%
• Introduced a machine learning pipeline for time series process optimization, which suggests to utilize two machine learning models as a predictor and optimizer respectfully and surpasses pipelines with classical solvers by 5 times in iron‑making process stabilization (L2 metrics)
• Introduced time series transformer model to the [company] platform
• Worked on industrial applications of quantum ML algorithms in various fields, such as natural resources development (Seismic‑Well tie) and sales prediction.
Laboratory of Relativistic Astrophysics MIPT, [location]
INTERN DATA ANALYST Febrary,2023‑September.2023
• Created the API (https://github.com/[name]K04/SaoCATS_Parser) for automatic collection of data and articles from CATS (Astrophysics Catalogs) and NASA/ADS databases
• Performed the analysis of cosmic source spectra (SciPy+Difmap) in search of quasar candidates
