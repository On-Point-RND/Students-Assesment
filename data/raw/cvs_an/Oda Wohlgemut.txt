Lab assistant
Optimization of the process of processing experimental data from scientific and physical installations.
AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY:
 Markup and preparation of data and datasets
 Development of neural network architectures for the task of classification of events registered by a scientific-
physical installation
 Development of neural network architectures for regression tasks (determination of the number of quasi-
parallel muon tracks in an elementary particle detector)
 Analysis and quality control of implemented neural network models
ACHIEVEMENTS:
 The method of processing experimental data of the scientific and physical installation has been optimized.
Human input is completely excluded, previously all data was processed by operators.
 A classification accuracy of 95% has been achieved.
 The accuracy of determining the multiplicity of particles in the events of the scientific and physical installation
was achieved FWHM = 1 particle, STD = 0.81
 A scientific article was published in the journal "Nuclear Physics and Engineering" on the topic "Determination
of the multiplicity of muons in DECOR events using deep machine learning methods"
 Winner of the XI International Youth Scientific School-Conference "Modern Problems of Physics and
Technology"
 Participation in 2 scientific conferences with the publication of abstracts.
Lab assistant

AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY:
 Construction of ETL processes for the allocation and formation of databases that have worked simultaneously
with scientific and physical installations.
 Development of Database architectures
ACHIEVEMENTS:
 A new database based on the MongoDB database management system has been created
 Combined data from 3 large-scale scientific and physical installations
 It is possible to conduct research of elementary particles simultaneously at several installations
 Participation in a scientific conference with the publication of abstracts
Lab assistant
