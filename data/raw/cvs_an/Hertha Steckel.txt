scientific activity
I am currently studying for a Master's degree and researching the
topic of "Automatic creation of multi-agent systems based on LLM".
The goal of my research is to find ways to automatically create
agent and multi-agent systems that will provide the highest quality
in solving industrial and scientific problems.
The result of the work to date has been the submission of an
article to the IITI-2025 international conference.

I teach project practice to junior students. Under my supervision,
three projects are being carried out on the following topics:
Multi-agent system for solving machine learning problems
Generation presentations based on a given context
Graph RAG
diploma work bachelor's degree
The task of the work was to study the methods of constructing SQL
queries on user questions in Russian. The main difficulty was when
working with large databases, as a large amount of information
about the structure of tables and columns prevented the model from
giving the correct answer.
The work consists in implementation and testing of methods on own-
developed benchmarks, which allow to evaluate the quality of
text2sql in Russian.
The result was the successful obtaining of a bachelor's degree and
sending a paper to the B rank conference Coling 2025.
The research project was also presented at the IT conference DUMP
EKB 2024.
