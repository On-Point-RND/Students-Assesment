PROJECTSANDPAPERS
NTIRE2024Nightimagerenderingchallenge Jan2024-May2024
The goal of the challenge was to find solutions that process raw camera images taken in nighttiime conditions, and
thereby produce a photo-quality output images in the standard RGB (sRGB) space. In this project I was responsible
forsubmiisssionvalidation. ThepaperwitheresultswasacceptedforCVPR2024. NTIRE2024

The project focuses on color vignetting in smartphone cameras, exploring elimination methods and leveraging it to
reducecolorrenderingerrorsiinimageprocessing. Itresultedinthecreationofthewoorld’siniitialstereo-hyperspectral

WORKEXPERIENCE
[company]
Datascientiist&Master’sstudent Sep2024-March2025
In the company, I was responsib le for developing, deploying, and optimizing a RAG service for working within internal
documentation. I configured and fine-tuned the service using LLM and Triton Inference Server, ensuring efficientin-
ferenceandscalability. Additionally, I worked with speech-to-text models, setting up and optimizing their deployment
throughthesame infrastructure. Ialsodesignedandimplementedsyntheticevaluatio nmetrics to assess the
qualityofboth the RAG and speech-to-text systems. Beyond technical work, I completed several internal courses on financial
markets,financialinstruments,derivativesandfinanci alanalysisofcompanies.

In the laboratory, I mainly worked on elements of the image processing pipeline and computer vision tasksin
industrialprojets. In the process of research work, several Russian-langua gearticle saboutColorspacetransformswerewritten.

includes creating setup for dataset collection, managing collection process and markup with crowdsourcing (Mean
