Summary
Experience in algorithmic optimization of inference and the development of Neural Network training
pipelines. Proficient in end-to-end pipeline creation, of particular interest is computer vision tasks, I
have presented and provided results to HQ and conducted RD projects with top universities, received
two awards for research projects. Having succeSSFully deployed two project into production and currently
developing one more.
Work Experience - 3y9m
AI Engineer at [compaany] Feb 2023 - present
Key Achievements:
- Designed and delivered real-time video analytics solutions for up to 40 objects across dozens of live video
cameras, utilizing a cascade of 10+ models. Two projects are in production, with one in development in
collaboration with [compaany].
- Built end-to-end pipelines (data collection, training, optimization, deployment) for both cloud and edg e
environments.
- Designed a custom post-processing pla tform to automate metric calculations and AI operational track-
ing with creating a digital footprint, significa ntly improving efficiency in a resou rce-constrained banking
environment (98per corr ectly covered events).
- Optimized models using distillation, quantiza tion, tackled complex data challenges, including severe
imba lances and limited infrastructure.
- Mentored several engineer, fostering team gro wt and knowl edge sharing.
Skills:
- Specializes in Computer Vision tasks such as OCR, detection, object tracking, classification, regression,
image enhancement, a nomaly detection.
