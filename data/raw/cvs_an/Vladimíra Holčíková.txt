I would like to highlight the two-year language training at [company], since the summer school takes place there. And this experience is extremely relevant.
I am a developer specializing in Large Language Models (LLM) and multimodal models, with experience in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. My goal is to participate in cutting-edge AI research and development by creating innovative solutions that combine text, images, and other modalities.

Work experience
Junior Software Developer
[name]
May 2023 â€“ Present
I was running and configured large language models (GPT, BERT)
and created multimodal models combining text and images.
Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning and distributed learning.
Fine-tuning GPT with RAAG for B2B support service.
I uploaded the models to the company's servers.
Amateur projects
1. Multimodal chatbot with image understanding
I was running a chatbot capable of processing text and graphical input data using
CLIP and GPT.
Technologies: Hugging Face, Pytorch, Flask.
2. Highly loaded client-server video stream processing application on an android smartphone
I was running an application on Kotlin that transmits a video stream to a server,
where the video stream is processed and returns a segmented video stream.
Technologies: Pytorch, Hugging Face, OpenCV, Kotlin, Apache Kafka, Django.
3. Forecasting the parameters of a chemical element using chemical Bert
I have further trained and configured the chemical Bert for the task.
