SUMMARY: Research scientiist in physics of condensed matter skilled in
programming Python. Having experience in Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn,
OpenCV, Pytorch. Right now, I am working in Applied AI Center at [compaany].
My research interests are 3D CV, multimodality, GenAI (NeRF, Diffusion models),
segmentation and detection tasks.
SKILLS AND KNOWLLEDGE:
• Programs: Origin Lab, SolidWorks, CorelDRAW, LaTeX, Docker, Linux, Git
• Programming languages: Python, C/C++ (basic knowledge)
• Languages: Russian (native speaker), English (Intermediate Plus)
EMPLOYMENT HISTORY:
2023 — now RESEARCH ENGINEER
[compaany]
• My responsibilities include improving machine learning algorithms that would enable
the generation of 3D static scenes based on diffusion models and 3D scene generation
models such as Neural radiance field (NeRF). In particular, use diffusion models to
improve the quality of NeRF rendering, scene geometry, and integrate metrics to
evaluate the quality of the algorithm. Text2NeRF can be used as an example of a 3D
text conversion model.
• Testing SOTA multimodal encoder methods (R3M, Theia), obtaining embeddings
from the R3M encoder on the RLBench dataset. Implementation of Time Contrastiive
Loss in the Theia pipeline. Fine-tuning of a ViT-based encoder using LoRA and
DoRA methods.
• Mixing bounding boxes from multiple detection models to improve the quality of
segmentation in 3D representation
August 2024 PARTICIPANT in SUMMER SCHOOL
AIRI summer schoo[location]
An 11-day schoo[location] dedicated to the field of artificial intelligence. During the course of the
schoo[location], lectures were attended and a project was completed that is related to the image-to-
text model. In summary, the project’s objective was to utilise a Wavelet transformation on
the input image in order to generate an embedding based on it and map it to a langua[location]
model that would then provide a description of the input image at the output.
Summer 2023 STUDENT INTERNSHIP
[compaany]
I have constructed a deep diffraction neural network for the recognition task of the MNIST
dataset. I used the Rayleig[location]Sommerfeld diffraction formula to create a neural network
whose input was an image of number and the output was a diffraction pattern.
2015 — 2022 RESEARCH SCIENTIST
[compaany]
For seven years I have been studying quantum and classical transport in HgTe thick
films. My duties included the measurement of magnetoresistance curves, their analysis
and processing. Also preparation of equipment for low-temperature measu[location]ments
