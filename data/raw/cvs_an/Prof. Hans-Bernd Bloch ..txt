About me:
I am a first-year student at [compaany], Faculty of Automation and Computer Engineering (AVTF),
majoring in Control in Technical Systems.
From the very beginning of my studies, I’ve been deeply interested in the practical application of
artificial intelligence, particularly in the areas of neural networks, predictive analytics, and
intelligent control systems.
I constantly strive to deepen my knowledge beyond the university curriculum — I study
advanced materials on machine learning, take online courses, and implement what I learn in real-
world projects. I strongly believe in continuous self-development and see education as a
powerful tool to shape the future.
Currently, I am working on a startup that focuses on forecasting demand for specific goods using
machine learning. Together with my teammate, we have already developed the core concept of
our product and are now building a working prototype.
Additionally, I am involved in a separate project focused on predicting cryptocurrency prices
using time series analysis and neural networks.
I am highly motivated to grow in this field, and I am confident in my potential. I am ready to
dedicate time and energy to learning, building projects, and contributing to cutting-edge
developments in AI and control systems.
