PROJECTS
Implementation of Orkiszewski’s Method, [compaany] 06.2022- 07.2022
Studied multiphase flow in wells and implemented Orkiszewski’s method for pressure drop calculation.
Also created a flow regime map and structured the code according to [compaany] standards for
integration into existing methods.
ImplementationofanAutomatedSystemControlInterfaceusingWinCCOA,[location] 02.2022- 05.2022
Control of viscous liquid storage using a PID controller and implementation of a dispatch system using
WinCC OA.
Longitudinal-TransverseBending,[compaany], 09.2023-
06.2024
As part of the thesis work, studied bending theory in various scenarios and conducted simulations,
particularly bending confined by channel walls and dynamic bending.
AlgorithmforProcessingTimeSeriesofSensorSystemCurrentsinVoltammetricBehavior,[location] 02.2023- 06.2023
Developed an algorithm to describe time series of sensor system currents in voltammetric behavior under
continuous operation, aiming to identify similarities and differences in their evolution under different
chemical compositions of mineral water and birch sap.
Doom Slayer, [compaany] 12.2024
Used the VizDoom simulator to navigate a randomly generated maze using computer vision methods
to build a dynamic map and apply search algorithm.
