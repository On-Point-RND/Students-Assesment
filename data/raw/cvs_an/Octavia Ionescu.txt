OBJECTIVE
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary Data Scientist with a background in Political Science and a Master's in AI & Behavioral Economics.
At [compaany], Iâ€™ve boosted customer targeting with response models, refined LTV prediction with 12-month calibrations,
and optimized data pipelines for faster modeling. My experience spans ML pipelines, recommendation systems, visual
reasoning (VQA, ChartQA), and more. I bring together statistics, machine learning, and product intuition â€” from hackathoons
to production-ready code. Whether it's modeling churn, buildiing recommender apps, or automating business logic, I focus on
delivering results that matter.
