Work Experience:
 [compaany] 2024
Built and fine-tuned a SuperResolution neural network using PyTorch
 [compaany] 2025
Developed AI modules for a photo editor: implemented object
segmentation with U-Net and fine-tuned GAN for background replacement.
Optimized inference for mobile, ran A/B testing on 50k+ samples.
Projects:
Driver Safety Assistant (Ongoing) - Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8 (with TensorRT
optiomization), FastAPI, NVIDIA Jetson
Developing a dashcam software solution for real-world deployment that detects
dangerous road situations and alerts the driver in real time. The system leverages a
YOLOv8-based model optiomized with TensorRT for edg inference, ensuring low
latency on embedded hardware like NVIDIA Jetson. A FastAPI-based service
manages real-time communication between the AI inference engine and the in-car
alert system.
