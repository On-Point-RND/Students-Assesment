Education:
• 2018 – 2022 [compaany] D.F. Ustinov (BACHELOR'S DEGREE), specialty: 12.03.05 – Laser engineering and laser technolologies, honors degree
• 2022 – 2024 [compaany] (MASTER'S DEGREE), specialty: 12.04.02 – Optical technology ("Technical Vision")
Professional development:
• 2023 Diploma of professional retraining at [compaany] under the program "Data Analysis Technologies", qualification: big data specialist
• 2023 Advanced training at [compaany] under the program "Principal Rising Star" (PI/PE schoo)
• 2024 Participation in the summer schoo on artificial intelligence "Summer with AIRI" githu
• 2024 Diploma of the Python AI Researcher course on the website mimo.org githu
Work experience:
• November 2022 – June 2023 Engineer
[location], [compaany],
Faculty of Physics and Technology
– Development of DL algorithm for a charcoal sketch segmentation of IR image (digital image processing algorithms, SegFormer), publication
• January 2024 – April 2025 Junior researcher
[location], [compaany],
– Implementaion of neural networks and machine learning methods into the developed algorithms
for solving problems of segmentation of small objects in the sky (detection, recognition, tracking YOLOv7, segmentation – Unet, SegFormer)
– Publication "Investigation of segmentation methods for small-sized objects against the sky" publication
– Prize-winning second place in the hackathon "AEROTON-2024", [location]. The task was to develop
an obstacle detector. Our solution was realized using algorithms for processing the video stream
(steroscopic vision, YOLOv7 for classification) and data from lidar and ultrasound sensors.
