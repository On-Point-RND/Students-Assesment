Work Experience
Research Engineer April ’24 – now
[compaany]
Various work on mecanistic interpretability, see papers below.
Machine Learning Engineer April ’21 – October ’23, 2 years and 6 months
[compaany]
• Strong experience in full cycle of ML development – from gathering and analyzing data to training and
deploying models.
• Two models still running in production. An example of project: an information retrieval system over multiple
sources. Built scrapers and parsers, gathered human annotations. Then trained a metric learning system on top
of the Sentence BERT with ArcFace loss.
