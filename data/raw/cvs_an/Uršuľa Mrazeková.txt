Work Experience
Orb Intelligence: March 2025 – Present
Leads a data labeling department. Participates in experiments on implementing LLMs for data pipeline processing. Supports existing data pipelines using dbt and Dagster technologies. Researches methods of data crawling with LLMs through open-source libraries and APIs provided by leading language model providers such as [organization], [organization], and others.
Institute of Precision Mechanics and Control Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences ([organization]): June 2022 – Present
Developed a mobile application and Telegram bot for classifying the severity of varicose veins using ResNet50, ViT, and DeiT models, with a Flutter frontend and Flask backend. Handled data parsing with Scrapy and Selenium, conducted load testing with JMeter, and mentored junior colleagues on frontend tasks. Participated in writing scientific articles and presenting at conferences. Led projects on time series classification, feature engineering, and model evaluation (Random Forest, kNN, SVM, CatBoost). Designed and delivered courses on time series analysis (ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM) and computer vision (edge detection filters, neural networks, transformers).

TapBank: April 2024 – February 2025
Created a Telegram bot for customer support using graph and vector databases (Neo4j, Pinecone, Chroma, Faiss), and implemented RAG, RAPTOR, and GraphRAG architectures for LLM interaction. Deployed services on AWS and GCP, containerized with Docker. Developed a web application (React, NodeJS) for visualizing job market statistics, with backend data parsing and processing (Levenshteiin distance, lemmatization). Provided technical documentation and product support.
Grid Dynamics: June 2021 – September 2021
Researched anomaly detection in multivariate time series using computer vision algorithms as part of R&D activities. Performed comparative analysis of algorithms and approaches for multiclass time series classification.
