Professional Experience
Senior System Analyst – [compaany], [location] (May 2024 – Present)
Designed the MVP architecture for a new “[compaany] Smart” subscription module (mobile
banking app), defining 4 core entities, 12 RESTful API endpoints, and 3 integration points
(Kafka event bus, internal tax service, Redis cache).
Authored comprehensive API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger) for a Kotlin-based
backend and Android client, ensuring clear contracts for development teams.
Developed a MongoDB data schema with nested documents and TTL indexes to manage
time-limited customer privileges.
Implemented Redis caching for frequently accesseed data, improving response time by
~60% and reducing load on backend services.
Performed code reviews (Java/Kotlin), optimizing data transfer objects and mappeers, and
eliminated legacy Java business logic, reducing system complexity by 35%.
Defended the system architecture in design committee reviews and coordinated cross-team
integration (backend and mobile), ensuring on-time delivery of the module.
SAP HR Consultant – [compaany], [location] (Mar 2020 – Apr 2024)
Worforce Management System Project: Integrated SAP HR data into a workforce
management (WFM) platform via SOAP APIs, enabling automated transfer of scheduling data.
Developed Python scripts (using pandas, openpyxl, etc.) to automate HR reporting tasks,
eliminating manual work and errors. Applied a machine learning model (Random Forest) to
forecast retail store transaction volumes for staffing needs, raisiing prediction accuracy (R²)
from 0.51 to 0.64.
Employee Mobile App (“[compaany] Sputnik”): Designed and documented RESTful APIs to
feed SAP HR data into a new employee mobile application. Created API documentation in
Swagger/OpenAPI (YAML) and tested endpoints with Postman. Guided three cross-functional
teams on API integration, and set up a Confluence knowledge base for project documentation.
Payroll & Tax Reporting Automation: Deveveloped custom payroll and tax reporting forms
(XML/XSD schemas and PDF generation) compliant with Russian regulations. This automation
cut processing time by 63% and helped avoid up to ₽53 million in potential fines by ensuring
accuraate, timely filings. Maintained up-to-date tax forms (6-НДФЛ, 2-НДФЛ, etc.), preventing
penalties (~₽800k) through compliance.
Technical Leadership (Feb 2023 – Apr 2024): Led a 4-member support team in the HR IT
domain during a staffing gap. Introduced automated system monitoring (with alerts for SAP
systems), reducing incident response time by 9% and detecting 17% more hidden errors.
Conducted 12 training workshops on payroll calculation methods, which reduced recurring
support queries by ~13%. Under my leadership, on-time issue resolution rate improved from
95% to 97.5%, and user satisfaction (NPS) rose from 48% to 71%.
