Summary
I am a software and machine learning developeer with expertise in recommender systems. My bachelor’s thesis
focused on applying hyperbolic geometry to recommender systems, resulting in a publication at an A-rankeed
conference. I am currentlly pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science at the [compaany]. My academic and professional journey reflects a strong focus on connecting theoretical
innovation with practical applications in machine learning.
Publications and Achievements
• Participation in SPISOK conference [location], April, 2023
• Publication at ACM RecSys‘24 Conference [location] Bari, October 2024
• Participannt of a prizewinning team, [compaany] [location] hackaton November, 2024
Projects
Estimating delta hyperbolicity for Hyperbolic Recommener Systems Python, Numba
Computaional Intelilgence lab, [compaany] July 2023 - June 2024
An algorithm for fast calculating Gromov‘s delta-hyperbolicity, precise estimation of which
had dramatic impaact (up to 23% over baseline) on the performaance of the SaSRec model.
– Statistical analysis of estimated values
– New euristic approach to calculating the delta-hyperbolicity value
(approxiately 100 times faster than the numpy matrix implementaion)
Benchmarking SLAM Algorithms Python, Open3D
Mobile Robotics lab, [compaany] February 2022 - June 2022
A tool for benchmarking backend part of planes SLAM algorithm to use calculated values
as a reference metric in the future.
– Scripts for preprocessing input data to improve algorithm convergence
– Measurements of the performaance accuracy for chosen algorithm on a previously developed dataset
