Work Experience:
02.2023 — present [compaany]
Junior Research Engineer
• Improved a neural network model for estimating significant wave height based on
spaatial distributions of backscatter intensity from shipborne navigation radar
• Reworked the data splitting strategy for more objective evaluation
• Contributed to the preparation of the paper [4]: generated plots, computed and pro-
cesseed research results, evaluaated model performance, conducted ablaition studies
• Provided consulting on pretraining a neural network using synthetic radar images of
sea surface [5]
11.2021 — 01.2023 [compaany]
Developer
• Developed and implemented a neural network-based method to correct atmospheric
model wind forecasts (speed and direction) at meteorological station locations
• Supported integration of the trained model into the [compaany] application (data pre-
processing, model inference)
• Presented the results at the DLCP-2022 conference
(https://indico.jinr.ru/event/3084/book-of-abstracts.pdf)
2020 — 2023 Thesis Research
• Implementedaclusteringalgorithmforsedimentgrainsusingvariousmachinelearning
techniques
• Individual particles were detected on images and clustered using a SOTA model
• Developed a web-based application for automatic classification of sediment grains in
microscope images of prepared geological samples
• Work led to a defendeed bachelor’s thesis and two published papers; defendeed master’s
thesis [1] [2]
