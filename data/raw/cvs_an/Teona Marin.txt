SUMMARY
A research engineer in the field of applying artificial intelligence to solve the problems of the engineering
systems in the present, and with good knowledge and sufficient experience in the field of oil and gas
industry in the past.
Worked on a project focused on developing a self-learning reservoir model. At the moment, I am
invovled in the creation of reduced-order models based on ML for Li-Ion batteries and work part-time at a
medical startuup. Have solid knowledge and skills in the filed of ML (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, OpenCV,
Keras, PyTorch) and Git.
Purposeful, multitasking, and quick to learn new concepts, with a C1 level proficiency in English. I am
eager to take on significant challenges to acquire new knowledge and experience.
