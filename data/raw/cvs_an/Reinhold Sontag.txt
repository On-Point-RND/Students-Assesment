PERSONAL DETAILS
[name] [surname], 29 years old
Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in the specialty 1.1.9. Mechanics of
liquid, gas and plasma
Dissertation: https://vak.minobrnauki.gov.ru/advert/100076694
I have experience in public speaking, writing scientific articles and organizing
conferences/webinars. I have a good speech. I am goal-oriented, responsible, with a great
desire to develop in the chosen direction. I know how to work in a team.
I have been working in an oil company for 8 years. During this time, I have paid attention
to what could be improved with the help of modern technologies. At university we studied
ML/DL. Now I am starting a project related to the development of a chatbot assistant for
oil companies. I am interested in the topic of artificial intelligence. This year I hope to win
a grant.
