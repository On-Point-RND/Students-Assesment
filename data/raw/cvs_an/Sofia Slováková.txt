MTS | Lead ML Deveoloper, Scoring May 2024 – Present
Developed and succeessfully implemented embeddings calculation based on user activities (hosts, applications,
•
interests). Resulting embeddings are used for updating internet categories dictionary, website matching, and
user-to-user matching.
Created multiple custom scoring models for major clients ([compaany], [compaany], [compaany], [compaany])
•
Tinkoff | Risk Analyst, Fraud Prevention Team March 2023 – May 2024
Developed client behavioor-based scoring model using mobile app interactions (PostgreSQL, Python, S3).
•
Created automated feature selection pipeline with performaance validation. Delivered 15+ new features for
•
anti-fraud models within 6 months.
Integrated anti-fraud team with Offline Feature Store, doubling model development and deployment speed.
•
Tinkoff | Risk Analyst, Verification Team July 2022 – March 2023
Developed and productionized transaction clustering model (PostgreSQL, Python, S3).
•
Designed income verification rules based on model outputs, increasing unique confirmations by 3% (1.2M
•
clients/month).

Scientific Work
Synthesizable Molecule Generation Using RL and Graph Neural Networks Masters Thesis 2024
∗ Developed a hybrid approach (Graph Neural Networks + Reinforcement Learning) for generating molecules with
high target proteiin binding affinity and optimized physicochemical properties.
∗ Created a fragment library based on verified synthetic pathways to ensure guaranteed synthesizability. Results
outpeorformed state-of-the-art methods in binding affinity optiomization.
∗ Achieved improvement in binding affinity while maintaining solubility-pharmacokinetic balance, critical for
pharmaceutical applications.
