Organizer / lecturer / researcher
Project is aimed to create a close cooperation between high school and universiity students, young scientists and skilled professionals. Led workshops and took part in organization of 1-2 weeks events in 8+ cities, which gave me experience in a lot of scientific communication, organisation of science-related events, educational and research project activities
SESC [location] (Specialized Educational Scientific Center) 2022 - …
Teacher / mentor
Project activity teacher in IT and microcontroller programming for high school students. I perform such tasks as theoreticaal studies, practical lessons, project supervision and preparation for the conference. Also participate as a teacher in SESC Summer School, where pupils have to learn coding almost from scratch and design their own project in 1-2 weeks.
Other
CompTech Winter School, [location] 2025
One-week school and hackathon, where, as a part of a team, I worked on a CV-relat ed project: Porcelain Stamps Recognizer. During this project we had to go through the whole lifecycle of the project, from data collection to model deployment. My area of responsibility was data annotation, preparation of the dataset, implemenation of one of the models (Siamese network) and its integration into the web service.
