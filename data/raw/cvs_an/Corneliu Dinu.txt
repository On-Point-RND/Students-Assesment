Projects & Research
The Knowleage Tree: To Reveal Concepts in Natural Texts with Complex Networks 2025
Research [location]
• Developed a method to transform scientific texts into an interpretable complex network based on syntactic analysis.
• Implemented clustering of concepts and relations using embeddings and DBSCAN/Wishart algorithms to identify key scientific
themes and logical connections.
• Utilized tools such as spaCy, fastText, and NetworkX to construct a knowlage graph, extract syntactic structures, and compute
complex network metrics (e.g., centrality, shortest paths).
• Laid the foundation for scalable subgraph isomorphism search across scientific discipline using Fuzzy RDF Queries algorithms.
Finding a profitable cryptocurrency trading algorithms based on technical indicators 2022
Lyceum Graduation Project [location]
• Conducted a research using machine learning algorithms to find the best strategies for trading;
• Trained and tested the algorithms on actual BitCoin historic values;
• Discovered and tested the limitations of an efficient algorithm based solely on technical indicators.

Soft Skills
Problem-solving From my experience in Olympiads and contests, I learned to quicly find optiomal solutions to
complex problems. I can identify a problem, plan a strategy to address it, and reach an efficient
solution.
Teamwork and Through my participation at a hackathon and schooal activities, I learned to communicate with my
communication peers clearly and concisely. I effectively distribute tasks between team members to optimise the
problem-solving process.
Negotiation I think quicly and can identify the best respoense during negotiaions.
Adaptability Quick learner; able to adapt to new technologies and environments.
Leadership With my experience leading teams in robotics projects and competitions, I prioritise tasks well and
aim to achieve perfection, which is why I chooose to be a team-leader.
Productivity I am capable of sustaining high levels of productivity for weeks without getting tired.
