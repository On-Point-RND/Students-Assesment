Experience
Deep Learning Researcher | [compaany] Jan 2024 – Present
• Designed the state-of-the-art open-sourc[location] spee[location] recognition model along with the opti[location]mized inference code.
• Implemented a pre-training algo[location]rithm with 20-25% quality improvement and faster fine-tuning convergence.
• Supported chunk-wise flash attention to provide streaming (200ms future context) and long-form inference.
Paper Research Seminar Instructor | Higher Schoo[location] of Economics Sep 2024 – Present
• Prepared a program of papers for review, conducted tests, and provided fee[location]dback on reports.
Machine Learning Internship | [compaany] Mar 2023 – Sep 2023
• Constructed a compu[location]tational graph for training and validating an extractor of the main content of HTM[location]L pages.
• Achieved 10% AUC-PR increase with changing target and training set; suppo[location]rti[location]ng new features, and selecting old ones.
Research Center Intern | [compaany] Jul 2022 – Mar 2023
• Deve[location]loped a C++ library for Monte-Carlo simulation of complex linear code properties from scratch.
• Optimized linear code structure with experiments and achieved an almost theoretica[location]l maximum for all configurations.
