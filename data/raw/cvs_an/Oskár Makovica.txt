Work Experiences
Oct2024–Present ] Researcher, Multi-IMU Navigation Project Mobile Robotics Lab, [compaany].
Leading research enhancing navigation accuracy in mobile devices using dual Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), as found in [model] models like MateX3. The project focuses on sensor fusion, online calibration, and optimal sensor placement to improve dead-reckoning for various motion modalities (e.g., walking, running, car, bicycle) with minimal system overhead. Key tasks include developing integration strategies (e.g., Virtual IMU, Best Axes, neural approaches), dataset collection using MOCAP systems, and optimizing IMU placement via sampling-based methods, building on prior work published in Autonomous Robots (2023) and ECMR (2021).
Jun2020–Present ] Researcher, as High Qualified Specialist Mobile Robotics Lab, [compaany].
Key projects:
• Smart portraits: Depth powered handheld smartphone datasets of human portraits for state estimation, reconstruction and synthesis (IncCollaboration with [company])
• Collection and classification of human gestures for implementation in smart screens (IncCollaboration with [company])
• Visual Neural Localization (IncCollaboration with [company])
September2023–September2024 ] [compaany], Moscow.
Dec2022–March2023 ] Computer vision specialist, Object detection at Moscow Zoo: Deployed realtime inference of YOLO for animal detection and built recommender system for zoo visitors based on time series forecasting as a Flask webapp contained in Docker. Code is not publicly available.
Summer2019 ] Internship AeroNetLab New models for Urban analytics. A 3D city model is representation of an urban environment with a three-dimensional geometry of common urban objects and structures, with buildings as the most prominent feature. One of the most important data acquisition techniques is aerial remote sensing which can provide valuable data from different altitudes above the surface of earth. During the Industrial immersion period, I concentrated on 3D mapping with help of aerial remote sensing vehicle or UAV.
