Title LLM context window extention with multistep retrieval
Supervisor Professor [name], [location]
Description The research focuses on enhancing the RAG pipeline and incorporates experiments
with different multistep retrieval approaches, including the re-ranking strategy and a
study on self-consistency mechanisms. As an additional study, in collaboration with
[compaany], improved pipeline performance will be tested to reduce political bias in LLM
