Work experience
LARSS, Skoltech-Sberbank lab
Research intern March 2025 – now
• Conducting research on macroeconomic forecasting using embeddings from anonymized bank transaction data
• Applying NLP-inspired techniques (Word2Vec) for feature extraction
• Experimenting with boosting models (XGBoost) and economic indicators like IMOEX and MOEXCN
Tom Tailor
Analyst July 2024 – now
• Implemented a store clustering algorithm using KNN
• Designed data warehouse SQL and Power BI to support strategic merchandising decisions
• Automated product assortment choice based on life cycle, seasonality, and pricing analysis.
Department of radiophotonics, MIPT
Research intern February 2024 – June 2024
• Engineered features from RS11 signal arrays by sampling data into logarithmic/linear intervals and computing
statistical summaries; trained a Random Forest model to predict sub-millimeter gap widths, achievinng an
average error 0.003 mm across test samples.
• Applied transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet-18 to classify transformed RS11 data as 2D images,
reaching 96% prediction accuracy within a 0.5 mm precision range.
• Compared classical ML and CNN approaches for gap width detection.
