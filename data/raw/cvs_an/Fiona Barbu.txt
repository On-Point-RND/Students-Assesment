to constantly develop and search for new horizons. I conduct my own
psychophysiological researches, which allow me to better understand the complex
interactions between brain and behavior. I want to study the program "Summer
School of Machine Learning" in [location] because I am sure that this project
will be a great platform for realizing my scientific and life plans.
