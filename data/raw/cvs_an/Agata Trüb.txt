Work Experience
Research engineer, [compaany] oct 2023 – present
Project: Stereo video compression, classical codes standardization
– stereo video compression based on both classical and neural approaches, depth-based view synthesis
methods investigation.
– patent and contribution to internal product, development of tool for compression of high frequencies
components of image.
– development of tools on platform of international standard codecs based on VersaTile Video Coding
VTM model.
Intern researcher, [compaany] feb 2022 – oct 2022
Project: Projection-space compression of Computed Tomography
Mentor: [name] [surname]
Supervisor: [name] [surname]
– compared existing compression techniques: classical (JPEG, H265) and neural (VQVAE, DVC, LSTM,
MLP)
– worked with raw DICOM CT projections and metadata
– conducted reconstructions based on 3 libraries: ASTRA, TIGRE, torch-radon
– conducted lung annotation (CVAT tool) and trained segmentation model
– trained and finetunned DVC model for projections data
– suggested to use loss functions in reconstruction domain
Intern researcher, [compaany] july 2022
– got acquainted with video sending principles
– worked with videostream tranfer with gstreamer library
Intern researcher, Department of Geoinformation Technologies,
Research Institute “Aerospace” oct 2020 - dec 2021
supervisor: [name] [surname]
Project: Unpaired style transfer between two classes of satellite images
Project: Increasing satellite images spatial resolution using Generative AdveRSArial Neural Networks
– learned to work with satellite images and their metadata
– implemented annotation task for objects on the map via ENVI toolbox
– solved unpaired style transfer task for images of 2 classes taken by 2 different satellites based on
StyleGAN and CycleGAN papers principles
– prepared dataset for superreresolution task, trained ESRAN architecture
– researched for several additional loss functions, resulting in better images quality for this particular
task (we were focused on seen more clear detailes related to railway infrastructure)
