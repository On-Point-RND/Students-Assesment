Job Experience
[compaany] (Data Science Intern) June 2023 — November 2023
• Conducted research on developing a new metric for user happiness.
• Used Python, SQL, ClickHouse, DataLens to analyze user data and NLP for requests in
natural-language.
• Applied statistical methods for hypothesis testing and A/B experiments.
Independent Researcher (LLM): October 2024 — March 2025
• Project: Solving Q&A Task on Tabular Data Using LLM
• Developed a complex LLM-pipeline that ranked in the top 13 by accuracy at the international
SemEval 2025 competition.
• The paper is accepted for publication at a workshop of the ACL (Association for Computational
Linguistics) conference.
• Link to the paper (pre-print)
Independent Researcher (LLM) at [compaany] March 2025 — Present
• Project: Evaluation of LLM AI-agent misconduct scenarios
• Used the inspect-ai library to develop pipeline for automated evaluation of autonomous LLM
agents’ behavioral alignment during tool use, enabling systematic monitoring, scoring, and anomaly
detection.
