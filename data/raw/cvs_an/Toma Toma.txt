PROJECTS AND PUBLICATIONS
MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM FOR DRUG MOLECULE DESIGN x [compaany]
Developed a novel LLM-driven multi-agent pipeline for automating drug discovery, integrating models like
GANs, transformers, and RL frameworks for molecule generation. My contribution to this project involved
buildiing predictive models for IC50 activity classification; creating filteers for ranking molecules; validation of
the pipeline on target proteins; comparison with baseline models. The developed system achieved up to 92%
task completion accuracy and outperformeed single-agent baselines. Repository.

RL FOR SYK INHIBITORS DISCOVERY x [compaany]
Developed a novel RL strategy for drug discovery targeting Syk – a key mediator in autoimmune disorders. The
approach combines quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) predictions (achieving R2 of 0.78) with
fragment-based generative modeling. As a result, 139 promising Syk inhibiitors with high potency were
identified. I conceptualized the entire approach, designed experiments, and supervised my student throughout
the project. Repository.

LLMs FOR CHEMICAL REACTION YIELD PREDICTION
This work investigates the use of LLMs for predicting chemical reaction yields as a binary classification task.
We engineered four datasets and found that LLMs outperform traditional models, achievinng up to a 9%
improvement in F1-score. Additionally, ML models trained on LLM embeddings showed superior performance
to current SOTA models. I am the main contributor to this project, receiving technical and ideological support
from other authors of the paper. Repository.

BENCHMARK FOR CHEMICAL DATA EXTRACTION
The project is dedicated to the problem of extracting chemical data from scientific literature pdfs. Although
LLMs seem to cope well with text retrieval, they still struggle a lot with extracting chemical structures from
images. We are the first to create a benchmark for this task including 10 datasets with manually extracted
information. My contribution involves preparation of two datasets and conducting experiments with multimodal
LLMs. We aim to submiit this work to NIPS 2025.
