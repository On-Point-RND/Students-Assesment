Education and Research Activities
 Honors Recipient at the All-Russian Conference and Competition of Student Research ([location], 2023):
Project: “Development of the ‘RS-V5’ Robot-Concierge Model.”
Achievement: Awarded a Third-Degree Diploma at the conference.
Project Description:
o Developed an autonomous robot model that performs a welcoming gesture upon detecting a human hand.
o Implemented software in Python utilizing the OpenCV library for image processing and MediaPipe for hand keypoint tracking.
o Designed a 3D model in Blender and produced a physical prototype using a MakerBot Replicator+ 3D printer.
o Integrated the hardware components: OpenCR board, AX-12A servomotors, and a plywood chassis.
Teaching Experience
I work with [compaany], an online school, where I teach mathematics to students in grades 5–11. I develop individualized curricula to help students master challenging topics and prepare them for successful performance on standardized assessments. My responsibilities encompass not only instruction but also methodological support aimed at enhancing student performance and motivation through a flexible, needs-oriented approach.
