About Me
I, [name] [surname], am a 4th-year student at the [location]
Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), Faculty of Applied Mathematics and
Informatics (GPA: 9.09/10). I would like to share some additional information
about myself.
I aim to grow in the IT field, currently specializing in analytics and machine
learning, though I’m also eager to explore other cutting-edgge domains in the
future. I thrive on real-world projects that provide practical skills, foster
innovation, and expand my expertise.
I have hands-on experience in project development and applied
problem-solving — most recentlly, I contributed to the startuup [name] [surname],
buildiing websites and Telegram bots during the past semester. For a full list of
academic projects, see: Academic Projects.
My programming background is extensive; details can be found here:
Academic Programming Experience.
At MIPT, I maintain a GPA of 9.09/10. For a complete transcript, visit: Grades.
Beyond academics and work, I prioritize sports. With 12+ years of competitive
swimming, I’ve won multiple regional and city championships. I also played
hockey for a district team and enjoy volleyball, tennis (both table and lawn),
and other sports.
I believe my work ethic, responsibility, and passion for continuous learning will
add significant value. My goal is to join (or eventually found) a forward-thinking
IT compaany where I can cultivate a creative environment and drive impaactful
commercial/social projects — a place where people aspire to work.
