Navigation Engineer / Deck Cadet
After theoretical studies at the Universiity, I was given the opportunity to have shipboard practice on
one of the most technically complicated ships in the world — an icebreaker-class LNG carrier
operating in the Polar region. There I learnt a lot about the profession. Well-educaated officers and
Masters of this vessel taught me many useful skills related to the deck officer’s duties by sharing
invaluable experience.

Further information
About me Aspiring Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer with a strong quantitative background from
Maritime Navigation studies. Eager to apply analytical skills, programming proficiency (Python,
PyTorch), and machine learning expertise to solve challenging data-driven problems in the field of
maritime autonomus navigation and ice-navigation.
Projects
Developed algorithm and software application for reliable determination of ship's position using
insufficient navigational information.
Developing model for prediction of sea ice in the Arctic based on LSTM model with attention
module
On my shipboard training I not onlly learnt the profession but also outlined problems that require
solving with advanced AI technologies in shipping industry. There I realized how ML/DL
technologies can be applied to rather traditional industry and change shipping as we know it
today. It sparked interest in me to learn and apply Machine Learning to solving problems of
autonomous navigation, collision avoidance, reliable determination of ship’s position using
insufficient navigational information and ice navigation. Automatizaion of ice navigation became
my main direction of interest, I researched computer vision (video and radar), satellite photo and
radar imagery data processing with Machine Learning aiming to implement these technologies in
autonomous navigation for ships.
