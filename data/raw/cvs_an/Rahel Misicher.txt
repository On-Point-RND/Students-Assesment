Education
2022 –2025
Techical school of innovation [compaany], [location]
The program focused on algorithms, data structures, OOP, databases (SQL), and modern software
development practices. Gained hands-on experience in frontend (React, React Router, Redux,
Tailwind CSS) and backend (Flask, Django). Also trained in data analysis and visualization (Pandas,
Mtplotlib, Plotly, Folium), time series, and big data tools. Emphasized applied learning through
team-based projects and concluded with a startup development in place of a traditional thesis,
combining real-world product building with academic knowledge.
