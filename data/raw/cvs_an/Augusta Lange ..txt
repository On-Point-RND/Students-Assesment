Professional Experience
Data Engineer, [compaany]
Feb 2024 – Present
• Designed and deployed a real-time ML processing pipeline in AWS, handling 850k+ events daily; significantly
improved dental treatment planning workflows, contributing to a 2× reduction in post-treatment warranty issues
• Contributed to the automated detection and 3D removal of orthodontic appliances, resulting in a USPTO patent
submission
• Led data analysis projects to identify delays and inefficiencies in production pipelines, directly informiing resource
planning and team structure
• Initiated and led R&D for new ML use cases in dentistry, including inflammation detection and clinical feature
extraction
Jr. Data Engineer, [compaany]
Sep 2022 – Jan 2024
• Created and maintained Python tools to process and transform 3D dental scan data, enabling integration with
internal ML models
• Built datasets and ground truth annotations for ML experiments, improving model accuracy and development speed
• Enhanced test infrastructure for ML pipelines to support Linux environments and continuous validation of model
metrics
• Investigated and documented workflows for handling complex geometric file formats, increasing development
efficiency for future ML projects
SQA Automation Engineer Intern → Jr. SQA Engineer, [compaany]
Apr 2021 – Aug 2022
• Automated 100% of regression test coverage for a machine learning segmentation service
• Developed performa performance testing scripts for backend systems, identifying critical bottlenecks prior to release
• Participated in software testing for clinical planning tools, covering full-cycle validation from test case design to
deployment approvaal
• Built understanding of orthodontic domain through product regression testing and documentation review
Teaching Assistant — Programming, HSE
Jan 2021 – Jun 2021
• Provided detailed feedback and grading for 100+ student submiisssions, helping to improve programming
comprehension and reduce average error rates in final assignments
• Supported students in one-on-one and group sessions, contributing to a measurable increase in course pass rate and
student satisfaction
