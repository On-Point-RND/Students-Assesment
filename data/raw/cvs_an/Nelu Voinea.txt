OBJECCTIVE:
I am a motivated student with a strong foundation in competitive experience and a deep interest in NLP and large
language models (LLMs). I am eager to apply my analytical and problem-solving skills to research-driven projects
in R&D, particularly within the NLP domain. My goal is to contribute to pioneering advancements in LLM technoology,
working collaboratively to explore, innovate, and expand the capabilities of natural language processing
SKILLS:
Python/C++ NLP Linux
ML/DL Git Torch, Scikit-learn, OpenCV,
Faiss, Transformeers, Keras
EXPERIENCE:
AIDAO (finalist): October – December 2024
Participated in the AIDAO contest, a competition focused on advanced data science challenges.
Task 1: Applied unsupervised learning techniques to fMRI data to differentiate between 20 individuals.
Task 2: Developed a classification model to detect open and closed eyes.
TechArena Siberian Challenge (wiinner) November 2024
Task 1: Optimized SQL join operations to minimize cost while maintaining query efficiency.
Task 2: Applied Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN) using the SIFT1M and GIST datasets to maximize the
QPQ and Rcal metrics, while also identifying the Pareto optimum for these metrics.
Achieved 1st place in the competition.
SafeSpeak-2024 (prizewiinner, top 5)
November 2024
Audio Spoofiing Detection Hackathon for Voice Security
Gain hands-on experience with NLP techniques, including text preprocessing and model training. Trained a
Wav2Vec model to solve the antispoofiing problem in speech data, enhancing the system's ability to
distinguish between real and synthetic voices.
