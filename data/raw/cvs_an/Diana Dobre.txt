Research Experience
2024 Gambashidze*, A., Kulikov*, A., [name] [surname]*, Y., Makarov, I. Aligning Diffusion Models with
Noise-Condi-tioned Perception. arXiv:2406.17636. (*equal contribution)
○ Proposed a novel method that improved preference optiomization of diffusion models
○ NCPO method achieves 60% preference win rate compared to standard DPO
○ Personal contributions included designing the method, setting up experiments with
HuggingFace diffusers, writing the text
Work Experience
