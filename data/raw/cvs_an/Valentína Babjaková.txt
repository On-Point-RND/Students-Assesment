About Me
My research interests are mostly focused on Large Language Models (LLMs), especially alignment, instruction tuning, tool-use and AI agents. I regularly engage in self-study by following lectures from [location] and [company] on machine learning, computer science, and mathematics, as well as reading scientific papers, attending conferences, and participating in hackathons and Kaggle competitions.
Work Experience
NLP Engineer, [company] March 2025 – Present
• Developing a multi-agent system (LLM-based) for [company] designed to register user incidents, assist with methodology, and provide user support related to databases.
NLP Engineer Intern, [company] November 2024 – March 2025
• Studied and implemented state-of-the-art research papers on Text2SQL and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
• Optimized databases to enhance compatibility with Text2SQL systems.
• Developed and expanded a Text2SQL workflow into an agent AI Agent capable of handling complex and ambiguous queries.
• Worked on deployment of Text2SQL agent in production.
Student Project, [company] October 2024 – Present
• Ran experiments on applicability of different MOS-models for TTS dataset filtering for TTS pretraining.
• Ran experiments with fine-tuning TorToiSe model for the same task.
• Improved ROC-AUC from 0.88 (previously used model) to 0.93 (new model).
