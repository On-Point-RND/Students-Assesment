Projects
Semantic Image Editing with GANs May 2024
Coursework, 3rd year
• Conducted a comparative analysis of the most popular methods for semantic image editing.
• Proposed enhancements to improve optimization in latent space w based on StyleCLIP method.
• Explored a novel approach involving optimization in the space of middle feature maps of StyleGAN.
Computer Analysis of Adaptive Dynamics Biological Model Jun 2023
Coursework, 2nd year
• Explored two-dimensional simulations of Dieckmann-Law model
• Optimized simulations code, pausing calculations upon plateau signs, leading to substantial resource savings.
• Generated a dataset with 30K of examples
• Examined the applicability of machine learning models to the dataset
Compression of Code Language Models Aug 2024
Team Project
• Applied SVD LLM and Shortened Llama methods for compressing code language models and explored their combination.
• Found that compressing middle layers while keeping the first and last layers intact yields better results.
• The combined approach achieved a better balance between model size and performance.
Movie Recommendations on the KION Dataset Aug 2023
• Conducted EDA of data and recommendations
• Trained and validated baseline models: Implicit, LightFM, ALS
• Trained a two-step model: LightFM + CatBoost
