Work experience and projects
Participation in competitions and development of devices
• I was developing a design for an autonomous rotary platform, which my husband and I made
together to participate in universiity competitions.
• I am currentlly working on two projects: the creation of an educational electronic constructor for
students interested in robotics, and the creation of a mobile robot promoter.
Skills
• Programming and development: CoDeSys, Arduino IDE, Python, MATLAB.
• 3D modeling: KOMPAS-3D, Blender.
• Automation: CoDeSys, WinProLadder.
• Electronics: Experience in soldering microcircuits, selecting components, and integrating
software with hardware.
Additional information
• Plans for the future: admission to the master's program at [compaany] in the direction of
"Applied robotics" to deepen knowledge in modern methods and control theory.
• At the moment, I am completing work on a project to create a robot promoter and continue to
work on a project to develop a STM32 programming kit. This kit provides students with an
exciting opportunity to learn the basics of electronics and programming, as well as develop
theiir creative abilities and practical skills.
• I've alrready realized that robotics is my calling, and I'm looking forward to developing my skills in
this field.
