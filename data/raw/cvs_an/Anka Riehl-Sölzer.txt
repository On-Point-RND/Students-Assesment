TEACHING ACTIVITIES
During educational course Software System Design led a team project to develop a Sudoku game, guiding team members in software design, version control (Git), and apps development [mittemim/Sudoku]. I have good skills of explaining material and am always glad and ready to share my knowledge.
TECHNICAL SKILLS
• Programming Languages: Python (Intermediate), SQL (basic), C++ (basic)
• ML/DL Frameworks and tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
• Data Visualization: MS Power BI, Python tools
• Version Control: Git (GitHub and GitLab, intermediate)
• Platforms and Tools: Google Colab, PyCharm, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, GitLab
TOPICS OF INTEREST
• Multi-Agent Systems: to find out the specific of multiple intelligent agents’ interaction and decision-making, its application to solve real-word problems and challenges
• Large Language Models: training and fine-tuning such models seems extremely interesting for me as they are now the most wide-implemented technology among both common users and organizations
• Self-Supervised Learning: focusing on working with unlabeled data and building powerful models is a cutting-edge technology in the modern world, so further research on the topic and implementation of the knowledge in this sphere are immensely important
• Safe AI: ensuring that artificial intelligence is both developed and applied meeting human values, as AI is becoming more and more integrating in our everyday living will help to contribute to its development with all the respect to society and moral values of it
