PERSONAL PROFILE
I have a unique combination of skills and experience. I have 13+ years of experience
in petroleum engineering. I have a mathematical education and experience in
creating mathematical models of various details (problem formulation, development
of solution algorithms and numerical implementation). I have worked with classical
models and data-driven models. I am open to exploring new approaches and
models, and I am especially interested in approaches based on deep learning and
multi-agent systems which can be applied in oil and gas industry together with
classical models.
