Done the first comprehensive evaluation of Python code
papers to A/A* conferences or Q1 journals. Contributed to
summarization models at class and repository levels,
showing improvements in summarization quality with
additional context and few-shot learning, and comparing
various models using benchmarks and automatic metrics.
Implemented the complex pipeline on ICD coding in Russian with 5 LLMs and RAG and

AutoGluon and aggregated engineered 18 features which
includes inference of multiple LLMs, applying RAG, and
computing classical NLP features.

Software Engineer. I involved in ML and front-end
dewevelopment of projects on robotics and AI. I single-handedly
deweveloped the interface design of a robotic laboratory
complex. I am a product designer: predictive analytics for
industrial manipulators ([location], Fanuc, Siasun, Eidos) and a
system for golf club and fleet management. I negotia ted with
the customer about the product. Now implementing, testing,
and deploying for production the front-end of the predictive
analytics for industrial manipulators.
