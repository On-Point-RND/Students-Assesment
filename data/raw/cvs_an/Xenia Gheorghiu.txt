ADDITIONAAL EDUCATION 2024
SMILES
Summer SchooL of Machine Learning at [location]. This year, the schooL focused on topics such as LLM, generative
approaches, and others. During the schooL, I conducted research on improving the performa nce of large lan gua ge
models on mathematical problems using sparse autoencoders and twea king vectors under the supervision of [name] [surname]. Intermediate results were obtained: the twea king vector increased the number of solved problems by 50%.
We used PyTorch in this project.
Additionally, I participated in a poster session with a literature review on font generation: poster.
Generative Adve rsiarial Ne tworks (GANs)
Advanced training program. The course was conducted at SMILES parallel to the main program and focused on
gene rative adve rsiarial neural ne tworks.
WORK EXPERIENCE
Backend Deve lope r [compaany] September 2021 — January 2022
Python, Flask
Web pla tform for food ordering. My r esponsibilities included developing microservices, APIs, and writing unit tests.
Additionally, I took measures to ensure the self-do cumenting of the code base for easier future maintenance and
scalability.
Research Assis tant AI Center at [location] of Economics May 2024 — Present
Python
Workedo nth e task of automatic medica lima gesegmentat ion using classical compute rvision methods(activecontour,
filters). The relevance of this task is due to the complexity of collec ting medical data and the restrictions on its usage.
