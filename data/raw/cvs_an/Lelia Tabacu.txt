EXPERIENCE
ResearchEngineer Research projects:
Dec2023–Now
[company]
Adversarial Attacks for Sequential Data
• Developed low-bit quantization techniques for generative models, Models[link] implemented automatic mixed-precision methods, and designed effective
• Developed advanced regularization techniques for
model compression strategies. Optimized data formats to improve
adversarial attacks to enhance concealment and reduce
computational efficiency and reduce memory usage.
detection rates
• Applied these advancements to both proprietary product models and
open-source ones, bridging the theoretical research and real-world deployment to
benchmark the effectiveness of different adversarial
strategies across models and datasets
