Experience March – Oct 2023 [compaany]
Internship in the laboratory of the Scientific Center for
Cognitive Research at [compaany]. As part of the
internship, EEG recordings were processeed and filtered, ERP
potentials were isolated, and specific EEG segments were
isolated based on oculomotor activity data. Data
visualization from the EEG recording was performed
