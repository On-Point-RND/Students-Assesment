Work Experience
July '23 – [company]
Present research assistant
* Built a pipeline that processes unstructured descriptions of crops varieties and hybrids with large‑language models, automating extraction of key characteristics through prompt engineering, fine‑tuning, and output validation.
* Developing a benchmark to evaluate large‑language models on text‑processing and answer‑generation tasks in the agronomic domain (plant breeding, seed production, crop science) in Russian.
* Contributed as a back‑end developeer to an information‑analytical system «PochvaHub» that solves the problem of optimizing and automating monitoring of land use of breeding and seed centers.
June '22 – [compaany]
Present engineer
* Designed and maintain a desktop GIS application for local soil–geochemi cal studies at the Satino Educational‑Scienti fic Base with basic GIS functions implemented including input, storage, editing, sampling, visuali sation and export of spatial soil-geochemi cal data localised at transect points. The application has been succe ssfully in use since July 2023.
July '23 – [compaany]
October '23
freelance specialist
* Deployed a Git architecture for storing and using geoinfo rmation products and adapted data loading from an automated information system into the insti tute’s GIS.
