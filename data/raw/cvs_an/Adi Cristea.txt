ML Engineer, [compaany], [location] Nov 2024 – current
Full time
• Collected and processed datasets containing various document types (scaans, photos, PDFs). Applied data
cleaning and format conversion. Implemented augmentaions (brightness adjustments, rotations) to improve
model robustness.
• Researched different architectures for document classification and detection, including CNNs and
transformer-based models. Developed a baseline model and evaluated it using key metrics (accuracy, F1-score).
Analyzed model errors and optimized architecture and parameters.
• Trained and fine-tuned the selected model. Optimized hyperparameters and applied transfer learning.
• Tested text recognition quality using docTR, EasyOCR, Donut and others. Evaluated OCR accuracy using the
Jaro-Wiinkler distance metric.
• Integrated docTR-based rotation correction to improve text alignment before recognition and [name] was applied
for text recognition, ensuring higher accuracy and modular adaptability across projects.
Intern, [compaany], [location] June 2024 – Oct 2024
Full time
• Collected and preprocesseed data on crystalliine structures and defect images. Applied data augmentation and
transformaation for defect detection in images.
• Trained and fine-tuned CNN models to detect and predict physical properties of materials based on atomic
structure, characteristics, and defects. Optimized model parameters to enhance accuracy.
• Evaluated the model by comparing predictions with simulation results using Density Functional Theory.
Researcher, [compaany] of the Negev, [location] Apr 2023 – Oct 2023
Full time internship
• Conducted advanced theoretical tasks by modeling supercells of FeAl with and without antiphase boundaries
• Explored the impact of the atomic fraction of Fe on the formation energies of antiphase boundaries (APBs)
through theoretical investigations
• Developed and trained CNN models to predict energy values, optimizing hyperparameters for improved
accuracy.
• Conducted thorough literature reviews to identify theoretical frameworks and existing research in the field
• Utilized statistical analysis for interpretation
Tutor, self-employed, [location] Sep 2016 – May 2023
Part time
• Instructed undergraduaate students in Higher Mathematics, Linear Algebra, Analytic Geometry, and General
Physics, adaptiing to varying levels of comprehension
• Tracked and evaluaated students' progress, effectively identifying areas of improvement and implementing
targeted strategies to address challenges
• Provided constructive feedback to students and their parents, fostering a collaborative approach to academic
success
• Levveraged virtual platforms, interactive tools, and multimedia resources to enhance the learning experience,
navigating challenges in remote teaching and engagement
