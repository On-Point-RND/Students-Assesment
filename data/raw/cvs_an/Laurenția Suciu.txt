Work Experience
Intern Researcher, [company], AI Center
Jan 2024 – Present
Completed two research projects as a primary contributor:
● video prediction models for uncertainty-aware sea ice forecasting, achieved 1.5x RMSE improvement over persistent baseline;
Honors & awards ● neural ode inspired model for atmospheric radiation parametrization, achieved 2x RMSE enhancement and 3x speed up versus successor.
SMILES Research Contest
Both papers are under review. Gave a poster presentation on intermediate “AI for Sustainable
results at the conference CIWO-2024, received a diploma for the best poster
presentation.
