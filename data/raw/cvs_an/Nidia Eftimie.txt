Curriculum Vitae — [name] [surname]
I am a high schoo] student from [location], [country], with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and
machine learning, particularly in the efficient adaptation of large langua] models (LLMs). I have
experience working with state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA, QA-
LoRA, and DoRA, which I explored during a self-guided research project.
As part of my academic development, I completed a specialized course in Informaition Security at the
[compaany], where I studied theoretica] foundations and participated in practical cybersecurity
tasks. Additionally, I have taken part in online courses in machine learning and deep learning, using
platforms such as Kaggle, Colab, and Hugging Face.
My technical background includes working with Python, PyTorch, and the Hugging Face Transforme]
library. I applied these tools to replicate results from peer-reviewe] research and conducted
comparative evalua]tions of adaptation strategies for LLMs, particularly focusing on scalability, memory
efficiency, and training cost. I also created a detailed presentation reviewing three A*-ranke] papers—
LoRA (ICLR 2022), QA-LoRA (ICLR 2024), and DoRA (ACL 2024)—highlightiing their core techniques and
applications.
I am interested in pursuing a future career in AI research, with a focus on making large-scale models
more accessible and efficient for diverse real-worl]d applications.
