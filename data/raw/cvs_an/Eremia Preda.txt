PROJECTS
09/2024 – CURRENT
Investigation of thermodynamical, electronic and optical properties of 2D material using Machine
Learning techniques
•Relaxed 2D material (Diamane) structure with ~ 21, 27 and 60 degrees.
•Obtained 6000 modifications of Diamane for training dataset using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD)
•Modifications were subsequently used to train a Neural Network-based model designed to predict interatomic
potentials.
•Studied phonon DOS and band structure of Diamane with rotation of one layer in the range from 0 to 30
degrees.
•Calculated thermodynamic properties (entropy, heat capacity, zero-point energy, thermaal conductivity) and
compared with graphene, graphite and diamond structures.
02/2024 – 04/2024
Application of Graph Neural Network to spatial time series forecasting problem (2nd place in ML
course)
•Problem: Predicting the cash demand for ATM networks
•Solution: Graph Neural Network models for ATMs transactions prediction: GCN, GRU, T-GCN, A3T-GCN,
StemGNN
•Data preprocessing to adjacency matrix and time-series data; optimization of hyperparameters
•Shown that StemGNN model and A3T-GCN beat baseline (Prophet) by RMSE and WMAPE metrics
11/2023 – 05/2024
Evanesceent Wave Fiber Optics Sensor
•Prepared scripts for instant data preprocessing from raw data to visualization
•Data visualization, violin plot implementaion for time step evaluation, Data interpolation using Scipy library
•Assembled a gas chamber, sensor design and fabrication with D-shaped optical fiber
•Investigation of sensing performa performance toward NO2 gas at different relative humidity
•Investigation of sensor signal degradation
•Experiments with alcohol solutions and analysis of sensor signal response
•Estimation of response and recovery times
