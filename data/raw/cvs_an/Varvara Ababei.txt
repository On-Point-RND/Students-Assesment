WORK EXPERIENCE
[company] [compaany] [location]
Machine Learning Engineer Feb 2025 – Present
Project: "Multimodal Data Infrastructure"
• Designing data storage infrastructure for multimodal datasets (text, images, function, audio, structured data)
• Developing automated validation pipelines to ensure data quality (e.g., deduplication, factchcheck, etc.)
Project: "Reasoning Model Development"
• Collecting, preprocessing and validating data for reasoning-focused models to enhance step-by-step
problem-solving capabilities.
International Laboratory of Applied Network Analysis [location]
Research Intern Jan 2024 – Dec 2024
Project: "Interview Analysis Using LLMs" | R&D Project ID: 5.0134-2024
• Trained FastText and fine-tuned BERT models to extract key elements from interviews.
• Calculated interview similarity using graph-based metrics and visualized results with NetworkX.
✓ Designed a pipeline for the R&D project "Discourse Analysis Tool for Russian Interviews Using LLMs"
✓ Replicated the pipeline across 3+ projects, improving workflow efficiency by 20%.
Project: "NER and Sentiment Analysis in Sociological Surveys"
• Fine-tuned LLMs for domain-specific sentiment analysis (public opinion on social issues).
• Implemented NER to extract targeted entities (organizations, locations, personalities) from survey responses.
PROJECTS & RESEARCH
"Evaluating Emotion Prompting Methods in LLM" (Yandex StudentCamp with AIRI) July 2024
• Developed a YaGPT-based agent interaction logic for emotion simulation.
