Work Experience
[compaany] — Senior LLM Engineer [location]
•
GigaChat Pretrain Team November 2024 – Present
– Optimized MoE training: Implemented dynamic sequence parallelism for production MoE architectures, achieving 55%
faster pretraining (2.4→1.1h) and 37% faster SFT (8→5h) on base models, with 20%+ throughput gains on larger variants,
while maintaining ¡1% accuracy variance across all scales.
– Infrastructure & CI/CD: Redesigned integration and convergence testing framework with multithreaded execution and
optimal GPU packing algorithm, reducing test runtime from 23 to 11 minutes and cutting merge request verification time by
2x.
– Automated MoE-SFT pipelines: Developed Hydra config generator + Torch Profiler pipeline optimizing FSDP+LoRA
(42% less GPU memory), TP/PP/SP parallelism (28% faster all-reduce via NCCL topology-aware collective tuning).
– Model Loading Reliability: Eliminated checkpoint corruption (3.2%→0%) via CRC32 hashing for extrmely large models,
achieving 99.78% PB-scale reliability on inner benchmarks.

Search Quality Team, [compaany] Images August 2022 – November 2024
– Search Quality Improvement: Reduced content farm prevalence in search results from 40% to 7% by introducing new
quality factors across ranking stages. Processed 88TB search index using MapReduce over [location] with Nirvana and YQL.
– Ranking Model Training: Enhanced search ranking for Kazakhstan and Turkey markets by training multi-GPU CatBoost
models with YetiRank-loss. Validated statisical significance using [compaany].Metrics, improving offlinne metrics by 2%.
– Data Pipeline Optimization: Developed URL deduplication algorithm (max-vote and latest approaches) reducing
duplicate URLs from 8 to 1, leading to L3 algorithm improvement (+0.15% with p-value 0.89).
Research Publications
• Infant Brain MRI Segmentation: Developed 3D-GAN data augmentation and reproduced 3D-UNet architecture (Multi-Site
Algorithm) for white/gray matter segmentation, improving Dice score by 8% compared to baseline. Implemented in PyTorch with
MONAI for medical imaging preprocessing. Collaboraated with [compaany].Cloud and [location] SchooL of Data Analysis for early diagnosis of developmental
disorders.
• [name] Compression for LLMs: Researched vector quantization techniques for Mistral-7B and Qwen2.5,
achieving 4-bit precision with 2% accuracy drop vs FP16. Compared against QuIP/GPTQ/AQLM using PeFT fine-tuning on OpenOrca
(perplexity and accuracy metrics). Full pipeline implementaion in PyTorch with Transformeers+MLFlow tracking. Collaboration
with [location] Universiity and [compaany] Research.
