Work experience
Period of operation: 25.11.24 – present
Position: engineer
Structural division: Laboratory of Machine Learning in Geosciences
Organization: [compaany]
The Laboratory of Machine Learning in Earth Sciences develops and applies modern machine
learning methods and neural networks for data analysis in geophysics, oceanology, marine geology and
biology, meteorology and climatology.
As part of my work in the laboratory, I participated in a project to restore historical data on the
relative humidity of the atmosphere above the ocean, a key parameter influencing climate formation.
I used classical machine learning models (linear regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient
boosting) and a fully connected neural network (multilayer perceptron) to restore relative humidity based
on accompanyiing meteorological measurements. I used clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN,
hierarchical clustering) to identify and then analyze regions of the world's oceans characterized by
minimal variance in meteorological parameters.
I have developed a methodology to account for spatial and seasonal variability in humidity, which
has allowed us to create higher-quality models for data recovery.
I conducted a comprehensive assessment of the quality of the developed models, including an
analysis of the uncertainty of the quality measure and the target variable using the Bootstrap approach.
I investigated spatial patterns in model errors, which allowed us to identify the reason for the poor
quality of models in some regions of the world ocean.
Based on the results of my work, I wrote an article that was accepted for publication in the
scientific journal «Oceanological Research».
I have presented the results of my work at conferences on machine learning, meteorology, and
climate, including:
• " [location] in the United Nations Decade of Ocean Sciences. Resources and Knowledge" (November,
2024)
• "67th All-Russian Scientific Conference of [compaany]" (April, 2025)
• "Lomonosov-2025" (April, 2025)

As part of the professional retraining course, a project was implemented to develop a model for
predicting the average monthly income of an individual based on machine learning methods.
In the course of the work, models were trained and tested that allow not only to predict the level
of income using various factors, but also to identify key factors that have the greatest impact on the
formation of wages.
The project results were successfully presented and defendeed at the final certification.
