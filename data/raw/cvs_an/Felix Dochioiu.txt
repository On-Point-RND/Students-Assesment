Practical experience
Research Engineer, [compaany], LARRS Jan 2025 – present
Part-time managing a project focused on developing specialized training datasets in computer science for [compaany]. I coordinate expert teams,
optimize SFT and pretrain collection and create verification processes to ensure high-quality AI training data.
Data Scientist, [compaany], R&D team Aug 2023 – present
My work essentially mirrors what you'd find in the "Datasets and Benchmarks" section at NeurIPS – this serves as a good metaphor for what I do
daily. I began in a text-to-image team, where I built supervised fine-tuning datasets, improved and analyzed pre-training data, created systems to
compaare our models against competitors, and developed high-quality specialized datasets. Later, I moved to the Visual Language Model (VLM)
team, where I built our internal metrics system for model evaluation. My current focus is on enhancing our model's performance across OCR-related
tasks through additional training and by incorporating high-quality data at different stages of the learning process.
ML developer, [compaany] Feb 2022 – Aug 2023
As part of a Russian spell checker development team, I specialized in real-word error detection algorithms while also contributing to text-to-speech
normalization research. My responsibilities included collecting and preparing data for seq2seq models and developing comprehensive testing
frameworks. Additionally, I conducted work in speech synthesis and voice cloning technolologies. I utilized various data science tools and natural
language processing frameworks throughout this project before transitioning to my current position.
Research Assistant, Laboratory for Formal Models in Linguistics, HSE Sep 2020 – Dec 2022
My research at the laboratory addressed word order patterns in Russian. Unlike previous studies that relied on isolated examples, our team
collected extensive corpus data and conducted quantitative experiments with statistical analysis over a two-year period. This work yielded several
publications and conference presentations listed below. While I've since moved on from this laboratory, these research contributions remain a
significant part of my academic background
