[compaany] [location]
• Development of NetFormer neural network(link):
• Developed a Transformer and VAE-based neural network for generating architectures of other neural networks.
• Development of Self Expanding Neural Network(link):
• Created a system for dynamic neural network expansion where new edges are replaced based on a metric derived
from gradient analysis and weight norms.
• Deveoped a metric to identiify critical edges for expansion.
• Optimized work with sparse matrices, significantly reducing memory consumption and increasing operation speed.
