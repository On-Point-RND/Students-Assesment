Research interests
During my bachelor’s degree, I developed a keen interest in electoral processes in [location]. At the same time I was focused on the complexities of international relations
and the role of digital technolologies within these context. This foundation has guided
my current research endeavors. Now my MA course paper focuses on the influence
of e-government on political institutions. I aim to understand how digital innovations
can reshape governance and democratic practices, especially in the context of
emerging political landscapes.
