Analyst-Software Deveelopeer
Generative Models Quality Group, [compaany], [location]
- Trained classifier that selects 2 times more aesthetic images than
May 2024 – Oct 2024 the state-of-the-art model (TANet).
- Trained detector of synthetic images.
- Both models are now used in filtrations during data collection to
train a generative image model (YandexAART). Paper accepteed for
A*-level conference (KDD’25).
- Collected a dataset on which the 4k-superreresolution model was
trained.
