Yanex Search (Object Answer) Jul 2023 – Nov 2023
ML-Engineer Intern (Value Stream) Search and SuperApp
LLM SQL DataLens
◦ Created”QuerygenerativeTopics”forobjectattributes(tabs,metadocs,key-value)–madeobjectattributesusers-dependent.
◦ Built a generative Tag Cloud for object’s ”associations”. Research project, that can potentially be applied to different things.
◦ Made a model to detect text vandalism. It helped to automatically correct some of the complaints to the Object Answer.
