WORK EXPERIENCE
Internship, 2023 — [compaany], AI-startup, specializing in the field of
Computer Vision in medicine. Worked in a team on a project on
Self-supervised anomaly segmentation in the domain of medical CT
images. By the end of the internship a baseline algorithm and a proof of
concept had been suggested.
Internship, 2023-2024, [compaany]. Worked in a team on a project on
generative design in mechanical engineering (CAD, construction aided
design). For this project, an approaach with LLM fine-tuning to generate
domain-specific output, namely code-based representation of CAD
construction sequences, was chosen.
ML Engineer, [compaany], 2024-now. Continue working on the same
project. To this date, a new synthetic dataset and a refined code-based
representation of CAD sequences were developed and also some baseline
LLM models performiing on par with current SOTAs were trained.
SCIENCE
Undergraduaate (B.S.) thesis — Self-supervised learning in the domain of CT
images. I employed DINOv2, a SOTA self-supervised network in the natural
images domain, algorithm to train a self-supervised network on CT
images. For training, AbdomenAtlas, AMOS and CT-RATE datasets were
used for training. Pretrained network was assessed via linear probing on
multilabel classification on CT-RATE test set. It showed higher
classification AUROC per every class compared to CT-CLIP, a CLIP baseline
pretrained on CT images.
