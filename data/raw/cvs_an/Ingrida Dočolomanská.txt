CV experience:
* Developed and implemented a production pipeline to solve the problem of semantic
segmentation of forest species, based on scientific articles (EfficientNet+Deeplabv3, VIT, Swin,
etc.).
* Optimized data loading and processing, speeding up model training by 15%.
* Developed pipeline pretrain (self-supervised learning), improving segmentation quality by 10%.
Experience in the field of RL:
* Developed a pipeline for training and testing quadrocopters using RL (PPO, SAC) methods in
the gym-pybullet-drones environment for the task of position stabilization and movement to a
target point.
* Implemented the GAIL simulation training method to train a virtual pilot agent based on expert
data, providing an 80% simulation of pilot behavior.
LLM experience:
*Developed a RAG system with LLama3.1 web search using LangChain.
Team Leader:
*I have experience in managing a team of more than three people. Responsibilities: analysis of
technical assignments, setting tasks and monitoring the quality of work performe did on time.

About me Implemented reinforcement learning methods (COMA, MADDPG) as part of her
master's thesis. In the game, Starcraft 2 trained stalkeers to find the optimal strategy to
defeat the hydralisk. She developed recurrent neural network architectures (GRU,
LSTM) from Pytorch for this purpose. In the game Pistinball, from the Openal library, I
trained pistons to transfer the ball from the right side to the left. I used RL methods,
where the reward is calculated separately for each agent, and not for the entire team
as in Starcraft. https://github.com/[name]
Participated in the "Best Hack" hackathon, where she and her team implemented a
solution for the task of detecting spam transactions. We took the 4th place.
