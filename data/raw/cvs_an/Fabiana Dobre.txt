PUBLICATIONS
2024
Development of the Methods for Measuring Model Stability to Changes in Input Prompts
This study explores prompt engineering as a targeted interaction technique with machine learning models, a methodology that has
gained populariity in recent years. The primary goal is to enhance the evaluation of language models by considering their robustness
to prompt variations. The research introduces a stability coefficient for effectively assessing and interpreting model performance
based on their responses to changes in input prompts. The study discusses stability evaluation methods and demonstrates their
application through experiments with different Large Language Models on tasks from the MERA benchmark.
2023
Design and Implementation of a Smart Data Center with an Automatic Warning System for Air Condiitioning Malfunctiions,
and Temperature and Humidity Control
The research article focuses on developing an intelligent control system that can detect and prevent malfunctiions, while effectively
maintaining the temperature and humidity levels within the premises. By leveraging computational modeling, simulation, and
optimization algorithms, the research aims to optimize the energy efficiency and performance of data centers, contributing to the
sustainable and reliable operation of these critical facilities.
2021
The Problem of Microplastics accumulation in the Arctic Ocean
The escalating accumulation of microplastics in the Arctic Ocean presents a pressing threat to marine ecosystems. This study
addresses the issue through experiments, simulating Arctic conditions by freezing and thawing snow mixed with plastic. Utilizing
laboratory equipment to mimic wave actions, the experiments provide valuable insights into the transformation of plastics into
microplastics at low temperatures.
