ABOUT ME
Since school, I’ve been interested in a wider range of fields: from robotics to front-end-
development. Currently, my strongest skills includedesign and machine learning research.
I’m especially interested in topics that include world modeling, more effective ways of
unsupervised learning, generalization abilities of Transformer models.
I have participated in numerous hackathons, scientific and practical conferences, ex-
hibitions, and competitions since about the 7th grade. Since 1st year at University, I’ve
accomplished my first ML research project and worked at a startup.
I am currently a second-year student at Innopolis University, studying Data Science
and Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to develop brilliant software products rooted in solid
scientific research, build a strong personal brand, and engage in cutting-edge research
that pushes the development of advanced technologies.
