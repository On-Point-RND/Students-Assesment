Recent Projects Thesis Topic
October 2024 - Hotel Room Description Tagger In my thesis titled «Deep-Learning Based Framework for High Resolution Mosaic Generation and Efficient Image Compression of Satellite Data,» I aim to generate high-quality, high-resolution mosaics from publicly available medium-resolution images with a high update frequency, while striving to minimize the volume of stored data. The results of my work will be applicable both in their original form (since high-resolution mosaics are inherently valuable) and as input data for other tasks, such as segmentation.
April 2024 – Nested NER Study Project
I have compared two approaches: zero-shot NER using GliNER vs training span categorizer using SpaCy library. As we submitted our works in a competition, I took the 3rd place among all the students.
Research Interests
April 2024 - App for Tourist Route Planning
Other than geospatial & remote sensing data analysis, I am interested in expanding my expertise across disciplines, particularly in the intersection of AI and neuroscience. I want to explore how AI can be used to study and understand the workings of the human brain, gaining knowledge in neurobiology and cognitive science along the way.
July 2023 - Compound Scanner
As a part of a team, I build a mobile app to read chemical structural formulas from photos & convert them to common text notations. Since I was primarily responsible for AI part, I experimented with different model architectures, including LSTM & Transformer. I tried training them from scratch, fine-tuning pre-trained ones, converting them in different formats to run on edge devices. I started with using PyTorch, but switched to TensorFlow due to issues with inference on mobile phones.
