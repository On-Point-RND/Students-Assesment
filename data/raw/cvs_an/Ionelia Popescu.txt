Professional Experience
Institute for Informaation Transmission Problems ([location]) – [location], July 2021 – March 2023
Researcher – Lab «Reproduction and synthesis of color»
● Designed a novel color vignetting correction method, outperformiing existing techniques by 3x in
key metrics.
● Published results in a peer-reviewed journal ([compaany]).
AIRI Institute – [location], June 2024 – now
Researcher – Fusion Brain Lab
● Designed regularization methods for text-to-image diffusion models, improving personalization
quality by 15-20% in CLIP-T metrics and speeding up the method’s operation time by 2 times.
● Developed a knowledge distillation DreamBooth+LoRA-based framework, enabling adaptable and
30% faster fine-tuning.
● Proposed a hybrid training pipeline integrating latent space optiomization with cross-attention
guidance, reducing artifacts in generated images.
● Extended personalization techniques to SDXL and Flux, adaptiing methods for larger-scale models
while maintaining computaional efficiency.
● Conducted ablaation studies on loss functions and noise schedules, identifying key factors for stable
training of personalized diffusion models.
