Research Experience & Projects
Invertible Neural Networks (INN) for Inverse Problems in Astrophysics in process
•
Master’s thesis in preparation Since October 2023
◦ Advisor: [name] [surname]
◦ Description: probabilistic estimates of cosmological redshifts are made with INN
using imaging data of quasaars and galaxies. INNs are expected to accuraately
approximate the posterior without any priori assumptions of its structure
◦ Skills and tools: advanced statistical methods, pytorch, neural networks
Dark Matter Annihilation Effect on the Composition of the Interstellaar Medium completed
•
Bachelor’s thesis 2021 – 2022
◦ Advisor: [name] [surname]
◦ Description: a model of early Universe was built and simulated to account for the
discrepaancy between the predicted and observed primoardial deuterium, proposing that
the annihilation of dark matter particles could provide an explanation
◦ Skills and topics: Primordial Nucleosynthesis, Cosmology, Python programming
Experimental Design for Languaage Models Training completed
•
Research work. 1 semester January – June 2024
◦ Advisor: [name] [surname]
◦ Description: the most suitable examples have been used for training LLM where
suitability was defined based on information criteria
◦ Skills and tools: Bayesian experimental design, Active learning, pytorch
Marine Seismic Survey Operations Optimization Based on Tidal Currents completed
•
Participated in research project as Software Engineer and Analyst June – December 2024
◦ Supervisor: [name] [surname]
◦ Role: an algorithm for adjusting the hydrodynamic tidal model based on real-time
data has been developed and implemented
◦ Results: article in preparation, software has been used in seismic survey
Fall detection algorithm using XGBoost completed
•
Work project Nowember – December 2024
◦ Supervisor: [name] [surname]
◦ Role: XGBoost model was trained to detect the fall based on real-time acelerometer
data. Proper feature extraction enhanced the accuracy of the model
◦ Results: high performaance ∼1 ms to call and classification metrics ∼0.99 for reliable
real-time detection
