COMPUTER SCIENCE
I am a Computer Science student at [compaany]
with a strong focus on machine learning. My journey in ML began with
the [compaany] ML Handbook, and I have since developed expertise in
NLP and automatic speech recognition (ASR). I am proficient in tools
like Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Git, and Docker, which I have
actively utilized in practical projects involving generative models and
audio processing.
