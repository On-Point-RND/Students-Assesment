Hard skills Mathematical The study lasted 2 semesters. I know: limits, derivatives,
analysis integrals, series, field theory (gradient, etc.).
Probability theory These two subjects were taken as part of the same discipline.
and I know: simple and complex probabilities, conditional and
Mathematical total probability, Bayes formula, Bernoulli formula, basic types
Statistics of distributions.
Linear I know: operations with vectors and matrices, calculation of
algebra determinants.
Python Average level of proficiency.
I know: syntax, OOP, working with exceptions and error
handling, basics of SQLAlchemy, FastAPI, know and use
various data structures, generators, lambda-functions.
I know and use Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, PyTorch, plotly,
seaborn, matplotlib libraries.
SQL and DB The course is actively studied in our universiity program.
I know: syntax, SELECT and UPDATE operators, views, data
types, transactions, normalization. I can build a datalogical
data model.
Machine Learning Knowledge of classical machine learning algorithms.
Deep Learning I know and understand: principle of model buildiing, error
back propagation method, gradient calculation, theory of
linear models, RNN models, LSTM models, Transformeers, LLMs.
General A year ago, I discovered machine learning and realized that I wanted to
develop in this field. I learned the basic skills of working with data and machine
comment
learning models at SkillBox courses, and I studied mathematics as part of my
universiity program. Now I am trying to deepen my knowledge on my own.
Althought I have not worked on large projects, I have done a lot of training
jupyter notebooks where I mastered different algorithms. In the area of deep
learning, I implemented Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd library to better understand
the error back propagation method.
I am currently working on a project on stock price prediction where I am using
the LSTM model and Pipeline to process the data. My goal is to turn this project
into a product and implement it in Airflow. The project is currently 60% complete.
