● Machine Learning and
Deep Learning
Croossy Road AI agent
2024 y, September-December
The project involves two components: computer vision and reinforcement
learning. I fine-tuned YOLOv11 for object and agent detection and
classification. In the RL part, I combiined the DQN model with a grid
representation of the image. ● C/C++
● Java
Revise_Material_bot
2024 y, September-November
A Telegram bot that helps students repeat lectures. I used Gemini API,
RAG system, including modular RAG, chunking, caching, vector
databases. I also implemented user registration and saving
correpondence history.
“Textyle”
2024 y, June-July
A project aimed at creating a service to quicly change text style using AI.
My role on the team is ML - engineer. I used Llama 3 for styliing, by means
of fine-tuning. English - B2
