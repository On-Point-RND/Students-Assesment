EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
2023 Hackathon Winner [location]
First place in the [location] hackathon for developing an MSI/MSS-calling tool. Our solution involved analyzing sequencing data of specific DNA regions and developing multiple models using Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a convolutional neural network.
2022 Hackathon Runner-Up [location]
Second place in the [location] hackathon on studying the impact of psycho-emotional states on heart rate variability parameters. We used open-source experimental data to correlate physiological states with basic emotions through data analysis methods in Python.
