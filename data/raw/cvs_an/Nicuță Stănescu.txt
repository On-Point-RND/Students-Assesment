Experience
• [compaany] https://new.skoltech.ru/en/
PhD student Nov 2024 - Cur. time
◦ Scene segmentation and feature distillation in 3d: Created an approaach for contrastive 3d gaussian splatting
segmentation
• Artec 3d https://www.artec3d.com/
Computer vision researcher Jan 2023 - Sep. 2024
◦ Structure from motion(SfM): Incorporated neural 2d feature(point and line) detection and matching into SfM
pipeline, achieving up to 10% increase in number of registered images
◦ Neural reconstruction: Created approach for incorporating semantic, instance labels and CLIP features into
neural radiance fields

Computer vision research engineer Jan 2021 - Jan 2023
◦ Multimodal place recognition(PR): Created a neural place recognition approach based on metric learning
utilizing images and pointclouds, achieving lower number of false positives than using unimodal approaches
◦ SLAM: Created non-linear global pose optimization method for custom lidar SLAM, reducing the error in
trajectory
Research interests
• Machine learning and deep learning: Interested in new architectures for computer vision, multimodal data and
generative models
