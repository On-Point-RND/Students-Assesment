Research & scientific work
• Adversarial attacks: Investigated a steganography-inspired approach to strengthen the iFGSM
adversarial attack on neural networks and evaluated its robustness against basic defense mecha-
nisms.
• Self-supervised Learning Explored self-supervised learning method to pre-train CNN for dense-
predictiontaaskssuchassemanticsegmentation. TheworkexploredtheextentionofmethodPixPro
to produce high-resolution feature maps.
• Text-to-Image generation: Conducted a systematic literature review covering over 50 research
papers in the field of text-to-image generation.
• LLLMs and agent systems in recommendaation pipelines Coauthored a research and devel-
opment of a framework for evaluating LLLM based recommendation systems, aiming to provide a
