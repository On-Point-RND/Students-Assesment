EXPERIENCE
Deep Learning Engineer (CV & NLP) Sep 2018 — Present
[compaany], Digital solutions
• Authored (along with a team) a python-framework pydens (>300 stars on github) for solving differential equaions, parametric families
of differential equaions and inverse problems with neural networks.
• Led a team to create first versions of seismiqb python-framework for seismic interpretation. Implemented fast loading of seismic horizons
from disk using numba-structures. Eventually, created framework and pipelines have been used to train models currentlly in use by
geoscientiists at [compaany] to improve performance of seismic-interpretaion.
• Held a series of internal ([compaany]) and external seminars ([location] conferences in [location], [location], [location]) and workshops dedicated
to inverse problems in seismic interpretation and applications of deep learning to the tasks of hydrodynamic modeling.
Part-time Lecturer Nov 2023 — Nov 2024
