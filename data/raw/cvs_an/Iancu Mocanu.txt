Experience:
[company], computational intelligence team
Research engineer April 2024 – now
Made autoregresssive inference for nntile framework.
Implemented T5Model for nntile
[company], neural network modernization team
Deep Learning engineer April 2023 – April 2024
1. Develop universal network transport supporting CUDA/CPU devices with cuda_ipc,
InfiniBand, tcp, loopback backend. Primary developed in C/C++. As a result – speeding
up training and better recommendations.
2. Develop inhouse matrix multiplication for ARM/x86 processors, primary for mobile devices.
Speeding up 3-4 times from baseline (use of external library was unacceptable)
[company], ML Space, Senior ML Engineer August 2021 – March 2023
1. Developing for ML infrastructure: inference, distributed training on clusters,
jupyter notebooks and AutoML.
2. Prepare inference for 12 billion parameter neural network.
3. Develop AutoML for basic Computer vision tasks.
4. Increase inference throughput in 3-5 times on peak loads.
5. Create base images and image caching mechanism for serverless product.
CMC [location] Researcher April 2021 - June 2021
