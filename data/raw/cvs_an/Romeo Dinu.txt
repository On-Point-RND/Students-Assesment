Data Scientiist 2024 - Now
[company], Laboratory of Methods for Big Data Analysis (LAMBDA) [location]
LingvaInterpreter: framework for code generation in machine learning pipelines.
• Designed a self-correcting pipeline for error detection and repair in AI-generated code, improving output reliability through iterative LLM feedback.
• Performed benchmarking studies on generation accuracy, computational efficiency and robustness across different LLMs.
• Explored prompt engineering, fine-tuning strategies, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance code synthesis for ML workflows.
Data Scientiist 2021 - 2023
[company], Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics [location]
(Distributed Traffic Engineering, Compute First Networking) DTE CFN project.
Distributed system for Traffic Engineering that implements an architecture that combines Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Consistent Hashing (CH) technologies.
• Implemented hashing algorithm and algorithm for partitioning the network topology graph into subgraphs.
• Developed parallel launch of MARL-GNN in separate processes on all subgraphs, including aggregation of results and balancing of flows based on the obtained hashes. Parallel version of MARL-GNN-CH speeds up the algorithm by 1.4 times.
• MNN parameter tuning. Tested the convergence of the algorithm and its sensitivity to changes in traffic matrix.
• Modified the agent policy optimization algorithm, integrated with the network simulator NS-3.
