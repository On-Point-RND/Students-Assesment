GITHUB
PROJECTS
github.[name]
Matrix – Implementation of a two-dimensional matrix class in C++
for calculating the determinant and working out move semantics. To
be continued.
Diffrentiator –The program calculates function's derivative in a
particular point 'x' by representing expression in tree structure.
Expression was parsed with a recursive descent algorithm.
Processor – The program executes simple x86_64 asm code with
simulated RAM, labels, and branches.
