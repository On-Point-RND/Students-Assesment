Experience
05.2024 – present [compaany]
[location]
• Data analysis and machine learning specialist, R&D department
Developing a system for detecting faults in industrial electric motors and connected devices by analyzing
current, voltage, acoustic and vibration data with a focus on portable embedded system. Apply classical
machine learning, autoencoders, refiine unsupervised learning models and domain adaptation for fault
detection, study scientific articles daily.
In review process an article about classifying and detecting faults in electric motors and submersible
pumps at the early stages of defect development. In this work, I used AutoML, which outppeformed both
deep networks and popular boosting methods.

• Collaboration on a side project
Researching and developing a large language models-based multi-agent system in a game environment
(GPT-4, LLama, DeepSeek and experiments with others) as part of a task to create a specialized
benchmaark for such systems.
Skoltech
01.2023 – 05.2024
Skolkovo Innovation Center, [location]
• Research intern, CNBR
Developed and patented human-machine interface based on machine learning and an optoomyographic
armbaand. Presented this work at the NCM Meeting 2024 conference in Dubrovnik, [location] (preprint).
Studied methods for decoding optoomyography signals for recognizing handwritten input with an
imaginaary pen. Worked with a Kalman filteer, as well as classical and deep learning models (MLP, LSTM,
RNN).
Was involved in other research projects in the field of electrical stimulation. I participated in a joint
project with Skoltech, Motorika, and FEFU focused on the tactile sensitivity of hand prostheses (as
reported by Izvestia and other sources). Was respoonible for engineering part, experiments design and
conduction. Worked with electronics, designing, ordering, and soldering printed circuit boards, and
deveveloped a patented high-frequency electrostimulator with a signal shape adjustmment function to alter
human sensations during stimulation within microseconds.
03.2020 – 12.2022 LLC Motorica
Skolkovo Innovation Center, [location]
• Electronics engineer, R&D department
Developed over 10 device prototypes aimed at expanding the functionaliity of hand prostheses using
inertial measurement units, opticaal sensors, voice recognition, and wireless technologies. Gathered data
for the decision-making system embedded in a microcontroller. Designed and solder various printed
circuit boards, programmed STM32 and AVR microcontrollers.
