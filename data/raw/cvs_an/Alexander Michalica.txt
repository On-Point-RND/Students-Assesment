The hackathon was dedicated to the creation of a bot-assistant in
solving programming tasks. As part of the project, I was involved in
setting up a langchain-based RAG system, and developed a unique
method of protection against prompt injection
The hackathon was devoted to creating a multimodal RAG-system for
working with files. I was developing a graph RAG-assistant based on
lightrag with the ability to analyze graphical information.
