SKILLS EXPERIENCE
CV NLP ML DL ML Researcher | [compaany]
Numpy sklearn pandas z November2023–current * [location]
• Wrote code for extracting embeddings using transformers and the BERT language model for a code assistant project
CatBoost LLM BERT
Algorithms Mathanalysis • Implemented the full development lifecycle of test prioritization algorithm for company releases in production. Experimented with various M&D Lmethods, ultimately settling on an MLP neural network. This significantly improved model performance on validation
