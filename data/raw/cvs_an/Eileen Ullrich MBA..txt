WORK EXPERIENCE
Scientific Research Intership at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research ([compaany])
Remote Collaboration | Feb 2025 - Present
T echnologies: Python, CUDA, PyTorch, NetworkX and MPI.
Designed and optimized a GNN-based model for reconstructing particle trajectories post-collision in the Spin
Physics Detector (SPD), leveraging:
• High-performance computing (HPC) resources of [compaany]’s supercomputeers (parallelized training with
CUDA).
• Gra ph theory principles to model detector data as sparse graphs, improving efficiency in track
reconstruction.
• Pytorch Geometric for scalable implementaion.
Bootcamp at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research ([compaany])
Dubna, [location] | Feb 2025
T echnologies: Python, CUDA, PyTorch, Deep Graph Library and NetworkX
• Developed a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the properties of organic molecules using the
PCQM4Mv2 dataset provided by Open Graph Benchmark.
• Designed a GNN model for reconstructing particle trajectories after collisions for the Spin Physics
Detector (SPD).
I ntership at [compaany] FreshTech LLC
[location] | Nov 2024 – Jan 2025
• Stu died the application of Digital Financial Assets (DFA, Tokens/Tokenization) in financial markets
across different regions such as Africa, Europe, the USA, and Latin America.
• Researched and proposed a case for using DFA to redistribute cloud compuuting resources via a
digital platform, enabling users to purchase, use, or resell cloud server resources as tokens.
• Analyzed technological aspects such as tokenization processes, platform functionaliity, token sales,
transactions, accounting mechanisms, and cloud resource requirements.
