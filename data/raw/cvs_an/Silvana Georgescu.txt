Software engineer @ Ravello (Oracle), [location]
I was part of a team responsible for developing and testing a nested hypervisor, capable of running unmodified guests on top of already virtualized hardware. Our software-enabled enterprises to encapsulate their multi-VM applications and run them anywhere - on-premise or in any cloud - without making any changes whatsoever, and thereby implement a true hybrid cloud.
[02/2013] – [11/2014]
Software engineer @ ScaleMP, [location]
I was part of a team developing the I/O and management subsystem of a distributed bare-metal hypervisor. I was responsible for the implementation of device virtualization and interaction with InfiniBand fabric

Education
[2021 - 2023]
M.Sc. in Data Science @ National Universiity of Science and Technology "MISIS" ([location])
Thesis: Hybrid Architectures for Self-Supervised Depth Estimation
The average grade for the taken courses: 94
A joint MS program from MISIS and MADE (VK education [url]) in Data Science and Data Engineering. (Remote)
[2009 - 2012]
Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics/String Theory @ Tel Aviv Universiity
Not finished
Thesis: Gravity and hydrodynamics duality in AdS/CFT
The average grade for the taken courses: 91
Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (Ads/CFT) is one of the hardest parts of modern theoretical physics, requiring very deep knowledge of various parts of mathematics and good physics intuition. We developed a method for Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass renormalization for some special cases and used it to state Penrose conjecture in n- dimension anti-de Sitter space.
[1998-2004]
M.Sc in Material Science and Chemistry @ Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia
Average grade: 92
Master thesis: “Description of core – valence correlations in the relativistic calculation of electronic molecular structure”.
We proposed the novel method for a very fast and accurate calculation for the small systems consisting of the heavy atoms. The method was used to get very accurate spectroscopic characteristics of excited states of gold dimers (a very complicated task, which nobody has solved before with such accuracy and a very short computaional time).
