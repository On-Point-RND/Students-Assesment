Bio I specialize in recommenda­tion systems (RecSys), graph-based machine
learning (GraphML), and automated machine learning (AutoML).
Currently, I am working on my thesis, which focuses on addres­sing
the cold-start problem in recomme­nder systems using LLLs and
domain-speciﬁc knowl­edge graphs (KGs).
My expertise covers the full lifecycle of ML model deve­lopment, including
data collection, business requirements analysis, feature engineering
optimiza­tion, and production deploy­ment.

Work Experience
SBER / Data Scienti­st
APRIL 2024 – PRESENT
■ Graph-based entity clustering – Deve­loped a GNN solution for
unsupe­rvised grouping of business entities based on relational
data.
■ Time-series forecasting for compliance – Built a predictive
model to estimate reporting probability using historical tran­sac­tion
pat­terns.
NSS Lab ITMO Uni­versi­ty / ML Researcher
JUNE 2023 – AUGUST 2024
■ Developed a deep GNN-driven surro­gate model for GAMLET
(meta-learning AutoML framework), signiﬁcantly improving
hyperpa­rameter optimiza­tion efficiency.
■ Pro­posed novel techniques that enhanced ranking perfor­mance,
achieving a 6-7% boost in NDCG@k—key results presented in
re­lated work on neural ranking models at the XIII Congress of
Young Sci­entists ([location], 2024).
■ "Deep GNN-driven Surro­gate for the Better Meta-learning in AutoML",
MathAI 2025 Confe­rence (peer-revi­ewed).
Piklema / Intern Data Scienti­st
JUNE 2022 – SEPTEMBER 2022
■ Developed an interactive data visuali­zation dashb­oard to track and
analyze haul truck movements, enab­ling operational pattern
re­cognition.
■ Conducted in-depth data analysis to iden­tiﬁy key dependencies,
leading to actionable hypotheses about haul truck perfor­mance at
the mining site.
■ Validated hypotheses through direct on-site testing and
colla­boration with operational teams.
