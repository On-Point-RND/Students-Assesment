About me I am a Junior Data Scientist and understand that effective data management is essential for
any business. I am a 4th year Bachelor's student in the “Data Science and Business
Analytics” program at the National Research Universiity Higher SchooL of Economics. With
over 3 years of experience in developing the knowledgе and skills of a Data Scientist, I can
analyze data, find patterns in it and provide proposals for your business. I have experience
working in a team on educational projects in the roles of Data Engineer, Data Scientist and
Project Coordinator.
