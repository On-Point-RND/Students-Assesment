EXPERIENCE
[compaany]: GIGACHAT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 05.2023 — PRESENT
SENIOR NLP ENGINEER
• Contributed to the development of GigaChat, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) recognized as
the leading Russian-language AI system, enhancing capabilities in natural language understanding,
generation, and multilingual applications.
• Designed a multimodal content moderation model to detect and filter unsafe or provocative queries,
achieving a 0.5% false positive rate while aligning with modern AI safety standards and ethical guidelines.
• Engineered a versatile text embedding model leveraging GigaChat’s architecture to power discriminative
tasks (e.g., classification, clustering) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, enabling high-
accuracy semantic analysis and knowledge retrieval. [video]
GRADIENT & PERSONA: AI PHOTO & VIDEO MOBILE EDITORS 06.2020 — 05.2023
SENIOR COMPUTER VISION ENGINEER
• Created a retouch filter using classic computer vision (without using neural networks) in pure C++, which
worked quickly (< 0.1 sec) on the device
• Developed a lightweight GAN framework for mobile devices (iOS/Android), which resulted in app for real-
time (on device) face beautification masks: Persona App.
• Developed a framework for solving arbitrary image-to-image translation tasks. Brought to production
more than 50 GAN based filters for more than 100 million audience of the Gradient App.
• Conducted a lot of experiments with image-to-image translation, deepfake and face reenactment models,
etc. Also worked with singing voice synthesis tasks.
• Increased key production metrics like FID & Conversion Rate on 30% and above by upgrading the
training and data pipeline.
• Speed-up and deployed a lot of models (stable diffusion, pix2pix, etc.) for efficient use in production both
on the device and on the server, using TensorRT, Template AI, CoreML, TFLite.
YANDEX 07.2019 — 09.2019
INTERN ANALYST
• Have improved infrastructure, conducted user research and AB-testing.
