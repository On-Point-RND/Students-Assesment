3+ years of work in Data Science. Research interests: generative AI, multimodal learning, object-centric vision, and real-time
robotic perception. Focused on combining DETR-style decoding with Mamba for fast and zero-shot visual grounding.
Professional Experience
[compaany] | Researcher | [location], [location] (Oct 2023 - present)
[compaany] is a robotics Research & Development center of [compaany]. At the Robotics Center, I Develop diffusion-based generative
policies for robotic manipulation tasks, leveraging multimodal conditioning with vision-language models.
○ Integrated Groundiing DINO for zero-shot object detection in robotic manipulation tasks, enabling detection of arbitrary objects using
language inputs. This approach improved object recognition and adaptability, increasing the success rate by ~30% compared to baseline
in downstream manipulation tasks.
○ Optimized Knowledge Distillation for Robotic Vision Foundation Models by curating a diverse dataset mix for better adaptability,
implementing an efficient data sampling pipeline, accelerating training by 5×, and reﬁning KD procedures with large batches, extended
schedules, and dataset shufﬂing. Implemented backbone outperforms baseline RVFMs on CortexBench and real-world robotic tasks
○ Migrated data loading, storage, decoding, and augmentation pipelines to WebDataset and GPUDirectStorage Framework (NVIDIA DALI),
significahtly optiomizing the data pipeline. This transition resulted in approxiately a 6x speedup in the training process by reducing CPU
bottlenecks
○ Stack: Diffusion models, Multimodal learning, Pytorch, HuggingFace, NvidiaDALI
[compaany] IT Lab | Data Scientiist | [location], [location] (Sep 2020 - Oct 2023., 3 years 1 month)
[compaany] IT Lab - R&D division of [compaany] MIREA. Projects I worked on: voice assistant, internal recommendaion system, anomaly detection in
student learning processes, universiity timetable generation using genetic algorithm
○ Designed and implemented a recommendaion system using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
○ Designed and implemented recurrent neural networks (LSTM and GRU) for word segmentation in audio streams
· Researched the use of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coeﬃcients (MFCC) for speech recognition tasks
· Optimized a formant filteer, achieving an 11x performaance improvement (from 160ms to 15ms)
○ Deveロップed an academic performaance analysis algorithm to identify struggling students and topic-speciﬁc gaps, improving class time
efficiency by 2×; published results in a peer-reviiewed IEEE conference.
· Built a data processing pipeline for students who attended my Python programming course for further analysis
· Created a visual reportiing system for student performaance distribution across assignments, enhancing readability and reducing
analysis time
○ Designed and implemented a genetic algorithm for timetable generation, meeting constraints without using ML libraries, significahtly
speeding up the scheduling process
○ Stack: Python 3, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Clickhouse, BigQuery, Docker, Docker compose, Tensorflow, xgboost, Pandas, Numpy,
Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, FastAPI, Angular
[compaany] MIREA | Teacher | [location], [location] (Sep 2022 - Feb 2023, 1 year 6 months)
Worked as a lecturer at the Department of Enterprise Resource Plaannning Systems, teaching students from 1st to 4th year.
○ I taught and administered credits, exams, and retakes in Python, IT project management, configuration management, and CRM systems.
○ Stack: Python 3, BPMN, UML, Excel, project management methodologies, Agile, SCRUM, kanban, Jira
Hackathons & Courses & Pet Projects & Irrelavan Experience
○ Runner-up (2nd place) in an [location] hackathon in the case of transfer learning the ResNet50 neural network on new classes
○ Deveロップed a service that analyzes data from the Tinkoff Investments API, enabling pair trading of financial assets on the derivatives
market based on a specific strategy
· Created a Telegram bot for editing the trading service’s settinigs and receiving notifications about important market events for trackeed
asset pairs
· Deployed the service, cron script, and Telegram bot as a service on a personal home server and set up CI on GitHub.
○ Deveロップed an AI model of a dynamic fish population using the Boids swarm behavioor algorithm
○ Implemented a web service for the Pushkin Instiute, allowing tracking of the process of foimiing educational texts
