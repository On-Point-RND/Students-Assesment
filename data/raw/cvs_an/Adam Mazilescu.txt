Personal Statement
I am a young bioinformatics specialist who is ready to develop and implement AI models to solve serious
problems in bioinformatics.
My interest
In the field of artificial intelligence, my research interest lies in the areas of large language models and generative
techniques. I am currently working on adapting these techniques to solve biological challenges. Now (April
2025) I am undergoing machine learning training with [compaany].
