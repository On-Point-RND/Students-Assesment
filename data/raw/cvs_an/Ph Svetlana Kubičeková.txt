AI-Driven Agriculture & Vertical Farming Systems
Developed a computer vision-based crop monitoring system
using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to analyze plant
health, detect diseases, and predict yields in vertical farming
environments. Integrated reinforcement learning algorithm
to automate climate control (light, humidity, temperature),
reducing energy consumption by 22% while improving crop
yield by 18%. Deployed edg AI solutions on IoT devices for real-
time data processing in resource-constrained settings.
Tools: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, ROS (Robot Operating
System).
Auto nomous Undewater Robotics for Marine
Exploration
Designed an AI-powered undewater robot for seabed mapping
and object detection in low-visibility environments.
Implemented semantic segmentation models (U-Net
architecture) to classify marine flora/fauna from sonar and
camera data. Trained reinforcement learning agents for
adaptive path pla nning, enabling colli sion avoidance in
dynamic c urrents. Achieved 95% accuracy in identifying target
objects (e.g., shi pwrecks, coral reefs) during field tests in the
[location].
Tools: PyTorch, Gazebo (simulation), SLAM algorithm s, custom
hardware based on STM.
AI-Driven Robotic System for Additive Manufac turing
Developed a computer vision-powered robotic system to
autonomously calibrate industrial print heads by analyzing
droplet dynamics in real time. Designed custom object
detection algorithm s (YOLOv5 architecture) to track and
measure micron-level droplets ca ptured by high-speed
cameras (1,000+ fps). Integrated CNN-based regression models
to predict opti mal print head parameters (wawe-form) and
mi nimi ze misprints. Achieved 99.3% droplet detection accuracy,
reducing material waste by 27% and improving print resolution by 18% across metal/polymer additive manufa cturing
workf lows.
Tools: Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, ROS, high-speed cameras.
