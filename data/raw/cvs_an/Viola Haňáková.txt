Work experience
2024 – Now ML Researcher, Maths in ML & Physics-Informed ML group of [name], NSS Lab,
September [compaany].
Paper: Evolutionary NAS for Convolutional KANs.
The whole research cycle: propose and develop NAS algorithm (for classification and
multidimensional time series prediction), and propose new convolutional KAN layers,
conduct experiments, write the paper.
As additional activities
Published at MathAI`25 (oral)
Best paper award, IITMO Congress of Young Scientists`25
The paper is intended as a position paper for NeurIPS`25 (position papers are
the ones that provide methodological insights/state a position, not just propose
a method)
Took part in the ongoing work dedicated to searching conserved quantities in
differential equations with neural operator learning.
Startiing the paper applying our expertiise in stochastic differential equations to
Schrödinger bridge diffusion problems.
2023 – 2024 ML Researcher, AutoML and evolutionarry computation group of [name], NSS Lab,
December September [compaany].
Worked on Sensitivity analysis for AutoML paper (published in Knowledge-Based
Systems, Q1): concept discussion, manuscript writing, conducting experiments.
[name], Nikolay O., et al. «Integration of evolutionary automated machine learning
with structuraal sensitivity analysis for composite pipelines.» Knowledge-Based
Systems 302 (2024): 112363.
Pionered ongoing research directions within the lab:
Cellular encodings: novel genetic operators, integration into the GOLEM library,
theoretical results of convergence asymptotics for model tasks based on drift
theoems.
Applying RL for evolution hyperparameter adaptation with crafted features as the
state and hyperparameter choices as actions.
Enhancements of GOLEM open source library.
