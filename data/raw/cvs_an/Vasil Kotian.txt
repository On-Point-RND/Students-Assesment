Experience
FPI, [location]
Researcher
November 2024 – Present
● Developed a benchmark to compaare state-of-the-art lip-sync solutions, conducted a comprehensive
evaluation and analysis of the latest approaches.
● Researched and benchmarked state-of-the-art image-to-video and text-to-video generation methods.
Ceinter of information technologies, [location]
Software engineer
September 2022 – Present
● Developed a solution for detecting falls on video with 81% accuracy, measured as the percentage of
frames correctly identifying the presence of a fall, deployable on Jetson Nano.
● Developed a FastAPI service that uses camera data to determine a person's location and generate their
heatmap.
● Developed an autoencoder to determine if there was a spill in wells used for pouring metal, achieving a
True Positive Rate and True Negative Rate of over 0.9.
● Worked as a Java Backend Deveveloper, a service for interacting with the [company] payment gateway, a
notification service using Firebase Cloud Messaging, as well as several other services. Additionally,
implemented service interaction using RabbitMQ and monitoring of services using Grafana.
● Solved a computer vision problem of getting information from a photo of a counter (barcode detection and
decoding, text recognition, blur detection) on an image with an accuracy of 80% using zBar, tesseract and
various image transformations from the OpenCV library.
Summer with AIRI, [location] (Summer schoo l)
ML engineer
August 2024
● Participated in a project to develop a multimodal model based on multiple visual encoders. As part of this
work, I trained an adapter for LaTeX text recognition and integrated it with the CLIP adapter. In
collaboration with the team, we combined the TrOCR, CLIP, and CoDETR encoders with the QWEN2-0.5
language model.
Linza Metrics, [location] (Educational practice in ITMO universi ty)
ML engineer
September 2023 – January 2024
● Created a model to track people using Yolo+Deepsort, made an auto labeling for Kinetics dataset
Education

Samara Universi ty; IT project management (additional education)
September 2022 - June 2023 | [location]
● Participated in the creation of an Android application for handwriting recognition as a team leader.
Tesseract was used for printed text recognition, and Microsoft's machine learning TrOCR model was used
for handwriting recognition in combination with our own neural network for single-word recognition.
GPA: 5 out of 5
