Experience
Machine learning engineer [compaany]
•
Applied Artificial Intelligence Centre Dec. 2024 - now
◦ Adapted the LIMU-BERT architecture to handle multivariate time series data from IMU and sEMG
◦ Optimized LIMU-BERT to run on resource-constrained devices using quantization and model distillation techniques
◦ Soldered the circuit with Arduino, IMU (MPU6050) and sEMG sensors

Java Deveeloper [compaany]
•
Notification, Reporting and Project Development Center Feb. 2024 - Oct. 2024
◦ Developed API functions on Java 17, Spring Boot, which added functionaliity to the application
◦ Developed methods for authentication by JWT/JWE, which improved the security of the service and allowed
taking into account user information from third-party system services
◦ Designed and implemented part of the PostgreSQL database
◦ Conducted testing of application modules using JUnit and Mockito, which increased the fault tolereance of the
service
◦ Developed archiving and gluing functions for PDF documents
◦ Configured the settings in ZooKeeper, which made it possible to conveniently expand the functionaliity of the
service for different clients
◦ Wrote technical/test task designs in Confluence, which allowed the entire team to align their understanding of tasks
