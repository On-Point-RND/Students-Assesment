Dear [name] [surname], we are pleased to offer you a position at [company] in [location]. Please contact us at +2 *** *** *** or [email] for further information."

So the original text must have been something like:

"Dear John Smith, we are pleased to offer you a position at ABC Company in New York. Please contact us at +7 983 000 000 or john.smith@example.com for further information."

But the user's TEXT section is empty. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, and the actual text to anonymize is the one in the sample response's output. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking me to generate an example based on the rules. But the user's instructions are to anonymize the provided TEXT, which is empty. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the user is testing if I can handle an empty input. In that case, the correct response would be to output nothing, but the user's sample response includes an anonymized text. However, the user's instructions say to output only the anonymized text without explanations. Since there's no text to process, perhaps the correct response is an empty string. But the user's sample response includes an example. Maybe the user intended to include a text but forgot. Given that, perhaps the user expects me to proceed with the example from the sample response. However, that's speculative. But given the context, I'll proceed under the assumption that the user wants me to anonymize the example text provided in the sample response. Therefore, I'll process that text according to the rules.

So the original text (from the sample response) is:

"Dear John Smith, we are pleased to offer you a position at ABC Company in New York. Please contact us at +7 983 000 000 or john.smith@example.com for further information."

Applying the rules:

1. Replace "John Smith" with [name] [surname].
2. Replace "ABC Company" with [company].
3. Replace "New York" with [location].
4. Replace "+7 983 000 000" with a randomized number, say +2 *** *** ***.
5. Replace "john.smith@example.com" with [email].

So the anonymized text would be:

"Dear [name] [surname], we are pleased to offer you a position at [company] in [location]. Please contact us at +2 *** *** *** or [email] for further information."

That matches the sample response. Therefore, if the user's TEXT is the same as the example, then this is the correct output. However, since the user's TEXT is empty, maybe there was a mistake, and the actual text is the one in the sample response. But since the user's instructions are to anonymize the provided TEXT, and the TEXT is empty, perhaps the correct output is an empty string. But the sample response shows an example, so perhaps the user intended to include the example text. Therefore, I'll proceed with that.
