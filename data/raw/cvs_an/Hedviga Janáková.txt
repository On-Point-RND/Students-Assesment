EXPERIENCE - 3,5 YEARS
Digital Region. [location] March 2024 - Present
Developed project designs, led the development team, created specifications for data labeling, developed models based on CV/NLP technologies, deployed models to PRODUCTION, monitored the lifecycle of models during
operation.
• Implemented a road damage detection model using (Ultralytics), which allowed to detect 96.5% of road surface
damages. Created an algorithm for estimating the area of damages and extracting coordinates with subsequent
recording to PostgreSQL database.
• Developed a service for selecting activity clubs for children. Based on YandexGPT and a knowledge base of
clubs (RAG). Set up API requests using FastAPI and wrapped in Docker container. As a result, the number
of club registrations increased by 5%.
• Implemented RAG Pipeline for responding to user requests. Preprocessed and vectorized documents using E5,
automatically labeled the dataset and trained a reranker. Stored the resulting vectors in the Qdrant vector
database and configured API interactions. Wrapped the service in a Docker container.

Subscale AI January 2022 — March 2024
Developed and implemented solutions based on NLP and CV technologies, conducted experiments with
models, deployed and configured monitoring.
• Developed a document preparation pipeline using LangChain and a system for LLM interaction with the
corporate knowledge base (RAG). Deployed the solution on a local server using FastAPI and Docker. As a
result, information search time was reduced by 5 times
• Performed fine-tuning of LLAMA 2 and LLAMA 3 models using (LoRA) for technical support automation.
Developed a process for preprocessing corporate data and deployed the solution in a Docker container. As a
result, the number of requests to operators decreased by 15%.
• Created a system for detecting and replacing confidential data (NER) in emails based on BERT. Developed
an algorithm for contextual replacement while preserving business logic. Implemented API and deployed the
solution in Docker, achieving f1-mcrro 73% and accuracy 98%.
