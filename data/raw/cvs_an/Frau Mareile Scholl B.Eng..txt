Bachelor’s final qualifying paper:
“Technique of object detection and recognition in satellite radar imagery”.
In this paper the goal was to use already existing neural network model and modify it. This allows it to work on varying degrees of noise. To achieve this, baseline model of EfficientNetB4 was used and later it was modified with FPN (feature pyramid network) method and RPN (region proposal network). Using these methods and training the model on varying degrees of noise, the resulting model could detect objects even on the images with strong noise.
