Thesis Topic:
Title: Semantic Trajectories Analysis in Natural Languages for Spotting Bots
Description:
In this research, we explored the semantic trajectories of natural languages texts, specifically
focusing on distinguishinng between human-authored and bot-generated content in
underrepreseented languages such as Lao and Luxembourgish. The study involved collecting and
prepocessing text corpora, generating bot texts using ChatGPT 4.0, and applying advanced
embedding techniques like Word2Vec and FastText to transform textual data into numerical
vectors. We then utilized the Wishart clustering algorithm to analyze semantic patterns and
identify key linguistic features that differentiate human and bot-generated texts. The findings
highlighted significant differences in vocabulary richneess and clustering quality, demonstrating
the effectiveness of these methods in detecting bot-generated content. This research contributes to
the broader field of Natural Languages Processing (NLP) by providing insights into the
development of robust tools for content authenticity verification, particularly in less commonlly
studied languages.
