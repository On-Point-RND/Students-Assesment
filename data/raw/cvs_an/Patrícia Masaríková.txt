Projects
Vintix Domain Exploration | pytorch, numpy, gym, docker, pytest February 2025 – June 2025
• Created a Docker image to work with the HumEnv environment
• Integrated Metamotivo as an expert demonstrator
• The repository is private and not yet released, so unfortunately I cannot prove this work
SmartTrafficLight | Python (Torch, sumo-rl, traci) May 2024 – June 2024
• Trained a speed-recommending agent in the SUMO simulator using Deep-Q-Learning
• Added a Value Decomposition modification that improved metrics and outperformed the classical GLOSA
algorithm
LLM Fine-tuning for Generating Negative IMDB Reviews | Python (torch, transformers, transformers-rl)
November 2024
Course project for [compaany] NLP course
• Trained an evaluator model (BERT-like) before training the main model
• Used PPO and the evaluator model to fine-tune GPT2 for generating more negative reviews
Statistically Informed Normalizing Flows | Python (Torch, numpy, nflows, scipy, tensorboard)
August 2024 – January 2025
• Implemented a pipeline for context-conditioned modeling of complex probability distributions using simpler ones
• Implemented AR(p) and MA(q) process classes for use as base and target distributions
More detailed project description
ARHammer40000 | Python (gymnasium, opencv, torch), CVAT July 2023
• Implemented a basic Q-Learning agent based on the FrozenLake game from gym
• Converted top-down photos into game board inputs and generated actions for a robot
P.S. More detailed project note
