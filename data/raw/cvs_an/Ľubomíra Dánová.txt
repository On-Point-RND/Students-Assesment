About Me
I have been working with ML and NLP for over a year. I study various new technolologies and methods, actively
participatate in hackathoons, develop various personal projects (successful projects on my GitHub), and work on
different scientific and commercial projects.
Projects
Speech Analytics Service
◦ Iparticipatei nthedevelopmentofaaspeechanalyticsservicethatusesPBXAPIforcallextraction,Whisper
API for speech recognition, LLM API (Claude Sonnet) for analyzing employee script compliance, and
a database for storage. As part of this project, I studied numerous language models and Speech to Text
modelswithopenandclosedsourcecode,createdprompts,cooordinatedAPIswitheachother,designedAPI
interaction architecture, and wrote my own API using FastAPI. I work on audio processing for analyzing
face-to-face recordings.
◦ Tools: Python, OpeNAI, Anthropic, FastAPI, psycopg2
Chatbot with RAG System
◦ AspartoftheredmadrobotNLPbootcamp,IcreatedaLlama3-basedchatbo twit hawebi nterface,whi ch
was used to build a RAG system with email agent, web-search agent, reflection, router, and retriever
◦ Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, PyTorch, langchain, langgraph, streamlit, pinecone, sqlite
Chess Cheating Detection
◦ Retrained BERT to predict the most likely missing chess move in a sequence and fine-tuned it on a dataset
of games with real players and games with the StockFish engine. As a result, fairly good metrics were
achieved
◦ Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Transforme rs
Handwritten Text Analysis
◦ Built a pipeline consisting of YOLO for text detection on documents and a handwritten transformer model
for text recognition after detection
◦ Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, YOLO, PyTorch
Credit Scoring
◦ I worked on two projects in this area: classic credit scoring and hotel booking cancella tion prediction. In
bothcases,Iusedlo gisti cregression,naiveBayesclassi fier,rando mfrests,boosting,MLP,a swellasvarious
feature transformations and training sample modifications
◦ Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, PyTorch
