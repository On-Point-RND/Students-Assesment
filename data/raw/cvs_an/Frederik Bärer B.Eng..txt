Objective
To join the SMILES program at [compaany] and contribute to cutting-edgge research in distributed systems, AI, and
robotics. My goal is to bridgge theoretical and applied aspects of multi-agent tracking, stochastic optimization, and
IoT positioning, leveraging my experience in prototypiing and algorithm design.

Research Experience
Distributed Drone Tracking System
[location] State Universiity ([compaany]) | 2023 – Present
• Developed a prototype for high-performaance drone tracking using SPSA-based consensus
algorithms (IEEE Trans. on Automatic Control, 2021).
• Improved localization accuracy by 20% under arbitrary noise conditions.
• Integrated randomized methods to handle uncertainties in real-time data.
Mutual IoT Device Positioning
Collaborative Project | 2024 – Present
• Designed a decentralized SPSA-consensus algorithm for relative positioning of IoT devices
using ESP32-C6 and RSSI/ToF.
• Achieved ≤0.2m error in real-world experiments (see
SPSA_based_Consensus_Algorithm_for_Mutual_IoT_Device_Positioning).
Skills
• Programming: Python (PyTorch, SciPy, NumPy).
• Algorithms: SPSA, Multi-Agent Systems, Consensus Protocols, Stochastic Optimization.
• Languages: English (B2), Russian (Native).
