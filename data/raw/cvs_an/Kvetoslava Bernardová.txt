[compaany]
Education: Graduated with honors from [compaany]
[compaany] in 2021. on the specialization program ‘Applied Geodesy’, specialization ‘Geodetic Support
of Construction Supervision and Expertise’.
My academic research journey began during my undergraduate studies. Between 2018 and
2020, I spearheaded a team of engineers tasked with collecting, preprocessing, and annotating image
datasets for a software solution designed to detect defects in flat roll roofing systems. During this
period, I secured a competitive 500,000 RUB grant from the [compaany] to advance this research initiative.
I am the author and co-author of three peer-reviewed articles published in Scopus and VAK-
indexed journals, alongside multiple publications in the Russian Science Citation Index (RINC).
Additionally, I developed a proprietary computer program to streamline image analysis workflows and
presented my findings at national and international scientific conferences.
Beyond my research, I mentor undergraduate students in the department, guiding their academic projects and fostering their engagement in applied engineering and computational research.
This combination of hands-on technical leadership, scholarly contributions, and educational mentorship
reflects my commitment to bridging theoretical innovation with practical implementation.
I am currently working on my Candidate of Sciences thesis «A methodology for improving
resolution and fidelity of aerial imagery using generative deep learning architectures». This research
focuses on developing a new framework to address limitations in photogrammetric workflows by
integrating generative models such as GAN and diffusion models for distortion correction, noise
reduction and super-resolution of aerial images. The proposed methodology aims to address the gaps
in traditional image processing pipelines and find direct applications in remote sensing, cadastral
surveying and land monitoring.

Since 2021, I have been teaching at [compaany]
at the Department of Urban Cadastre and Engineering Surveys. Teaching disciplines:
 Engineering geodesy
 Applied geodesy (profile)
 Aerospace surveys
 Geotechnical fundamentals (construction industry)
In the course of my working life I participated in the development of the educational program,
lecture notes and laboratory workshop within the Priority 2030 on working with spatial data.
Responsible for the development of the chapter “Application of AI algorithms in spatial data
processing”.
 Participant of projects under the Priority 2030 program:
 Project №-15/23 “Creation of a digital model of the territory of industrial, recreational
and residential development subject to renovation in Belgorod region”,
 Project №-15/23 stage “Information modeling of territories on the basis of spatial data”.
 Participant of the scientific project FZWN-2023-0009 “Development of scientific and
technical solutions for adaptive control and modernization of autonomous mobile vehicles of serial
production for effective environmental monitoring”.
I am a Senior Instructor of the federal project “Personnel for Unmanned Aerial Systems” within
the framework of the state program of the Russian Federation “Scientific and Technological
Development of the Russian Federation”.
Hobbies:
Outside of my professional and academic commitments, I maintain an active lifestyle centered
on martial arts. I practice and coach junior groups in Army Hand-to-Hand Combat, fostering discipline
and technical proficiency in trainees. Additionally, I hold a Second-Category Sports Referee certification
in both Army Hand-to-Hand Combat and Muay Thai, officiating competitions to ensure adherence to
rules and fair play. My dedication to these disciplines not only enhances my physical fitness but also
reinforces leadership, strategic thinking, and teamwork—qualities that translate seamlessly into my
professional endeavors.
