Scientific and Research Activities
Project: Training Corvids to Collect Waste (2019–present)
•
Independent, long-term research project on corvid cognition and human-
wildlife collaboration. Developed multiple training devices and neural-
network-based systems for object classification and bird species
identification. Current focus on contactless recognition of corvids (video1 - https://t.me/[compaany]/298, video 2 - https://t.me/[compaany]/364)
and studying intelligence and evolutionary behavior in birds. Together with
the laboratories of my faculty, we have started a large study in several areas
at once, which we plan to submiit at the conference.
Project: Smart Pedestrian Crossing
•
Designed and implemented a prototype system using computer vision and
neural networks to detect pedestrians and illuminate crossings in low-
visibility conditions. Aimed at reducing nighttime accidents at unregulated
pedestrian crossings.
Project: Schooal Safety System
•
Co-developing an AI-driven video analytics system for early detection of
potential threats in schools. Utilizes multiple neural networks for behavior
analysis and person detection.
Sirius Center for Talent Development – “Big Challenges” Program
•
(2023)
Collaborated with [compaany] to build a machine learning model that
automatically estimates car value based on technical specifications. Focused
on model accuracy, interpretability, and scalability.
