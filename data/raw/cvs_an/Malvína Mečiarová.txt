Work Experience
ML-Developer (data-scientist), Department of Scientific Research and Development
[location] Universiity of Science and Technology July 2022 – nowadays
- Developed a traffic object classifier in 3D point cloud space. After preprocessing the data, achieved 94% classification
accuracy across two classes.
- Developed a traffic object detector with two-class classification in a 3D intersection point cloud environment.
Improved the PointPillars model accuracy from 73% to 88%
- Developed an intelligent traffic monitoring system for real-time speed and GPS coordinate estimation of traffic
objects using 2D camera data. The system classifies objects into categories: car, truck, pedestrian, bus, and van;
corrects image distortion; calculates object speeds with an error margin of 0.2 km/h; estimates GPS coordinates;
and generates movement trajectories. The training dataset was manually prepared.
ML-Developer (data-scientist), R&D project under a state assignment by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the
[location] Federation.
