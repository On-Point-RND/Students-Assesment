[compaany] Data Scientist June 2023 - April 2025
AutoML Service (AMELIA) 
Responsible for AutoML Baseline service: classic ML models on tabular data (automated
stages of data collection and preprocessing, model training, analytics, automatic
warnings and autodeploy and autoretraining). 
Decreased time to market of ML Models from 2 months to 3 weeks 
1500+ successfully fitted models, 20+ models in business exploitation, 60+ users 
IncrEased ml models metrics by 3-5% in average (ROC AUC) 
Created interface of AutoML: python library and UI with streamlit 
Promoted the tool by actively presenting not only to data scientists but also to analysts
and risk managers. 
Created the automatic retrain pipeline of models 
Collaborate closely with MLOps team. familiarity with Linux, Git, Docker, Jenkins, Airflow
AutoDL Service (ANNA) 
Participated in the development of the AutoDL: neural networks on sequential data:
(LSTM, xLSTM, Transformers) 
DecrEased time to market of ML Models from 3 months to 1 month 
Optimized code (Spark, pytorch), collected best practices, and improved architectures
of both base models and the overall final model 
Implemented a tabular neural network using state-of-the-art (SOTA) ideas, improving
results across all tasks by 2 p.p. gini. 
Created the automatic retrain pipeline of NN
