Dear [name],
I am sincerely excited to apply for SMILES, as there are many personal reasons driving my enthusiasm.
First and foremost, my primary goal is to master emerging techniques, particularly in generative models and multi-agent systems—through hands-on projects, lectures, and seminars. The school’s speakers have been a great inspiration to me. I’ve followed their lectures, explored their educational materials, and studied their papers since my school years. It would be an invaluable experience to meet them in person, ask questions, and simply spend time learning from them.
Secondly, the school offers an excellent opportunity to work on practical projects alongside peers. I thrive in collaborative environments, as they push me to grow the most in terms of technical skills. Given that the program includes hackathons, I am certain this experience will be exceptionally rewarding.
Lastly but not least, the professional network. It’s often said that the strongest connections are formed during student life, and I firmly believe this to be true. I actively seek every opportunity to meet like-minded individuals. Who knows, one of the participants might become a future business partner or colleague.
Regarding my education and experience, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the Higher School of Economics while also studying at the [compaany] School of Data Analysis. Additionally, I work as an ML Engineer at [compaany], specializing in NLP.
Last summer, I attended the student camp Math in Artificial Intelligence, organized by [compaany] and [compaany]. The format was similar - lectures and seminars covered topics like generative models, optimization, MCMC, matrix calculations, and more, culminating in a group project. My team worked on Synthetic Time Series Generation, enriching a Python library developed by [compaany]. It was an incredible experience that I would gladly repeat.
Much of my expertise comes from participating in hackathons. I love the challenge of creating something entirely new in just a few days, pushing my limits to generate innovative ideas.
In my free time, I’m developing a personal investment portfolio to using LLMs, which makes SMILES’ topics highly relevant to my interests.
Beyond my academic and technical skills, I value international collaboration. Last semester, I had the opportunity to study in the [location] through an academic mobility program, broadening my perspectives and reinforcing my adaptability in diverse research environments. Furthermore, I have contributed to the AI community as a mentor at [compaany], where I guided young students in developing technology-driven solutions, fostering their interest in AI and problem-solving.
What I expect from the school is the unexpected — even if that sounds paradoxical :)
I’m certain there are many surprising concepts and models I have yet to discover.
Looking ahead, I envision pursuing a Master’s degree in [location] or [location] and eventually launching my own venture to integrate AI into everyday life. As a lifelong dancer, I’ve also noticed numerous untapped opportunities where ML and DL could revolutionize the field. I’d love to explore cutting-edge developments in this domain. That said, I am still exploring different ML/DL specializations to find the perfect fit, and another goal of mine during the school is to detect a field that truly resonates with me.
I would be honored to contribute my energy and enthusiasm to SMILES 2025. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to the opportunity to learn and grow within Skoltech’s vibrant AI community.
