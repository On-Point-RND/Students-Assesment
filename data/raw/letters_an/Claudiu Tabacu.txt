Hello [name] [surname] committee!
My name is [name] [surname]. I am a Computer Vision Engineer. I express my strong interest
in participating in the summer schoo lprogram in person.
Academic background
I hold Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computer Science. My academic path was built on a
rigorous founda tion in mathe matics , linear algebra, statistics, and programming - the essen tial
toolkit for a deep and structured understanding of ML and DL . This background allows me to
engage with advanced concepts and contribute mea ningly to the summer schoo l
enviro nment.
Professional and research experience
Professionally, I am involved in the develo pment of an AI-powered mammography system for
ea rly breast cancer detection. My role includes the full lifecycle of AI model develo pment:
from defining problems and preparing datasets, to training, eva lua ting, opti mizing, and
deploying models. This includes working with production-ready formats like ONNX and
TensorRT, ensuring the models meet real-worl d perfor mance standards.
I contributed to a project focused on the semantic segm entation of malignant calcifica tions. A
key research contribution was the generation of synthetic malignant calcifica tions. This helps to
improve the F1-score by 16%. This knowl edge helps the summer schoo l team build a strong
pipeline.
Motivation for in-person participation
I believe that in-person participation offers an unmatched oppo rtunity to engage deeply with the
material, speakers, and fellow atten dees. Face-to-face discussions, hands-on workshops, and
spo ntaneous colla borations foster a level of engagement and idea exchange that is diffi cult to
replicate virtually.
Addit ionally, I completed my entire Master's program in English, which has equipped me with
the lan gua ge skills necessa ry to actively participate in technical discussions and colla borative
proje cts.
Expecta tions and future plans
Through this summer schoo l, I hope to deepen my knowl edge in cutting-e dg e topics presented
by leading researchers and practititioners. I am particularly excited about engaging with a
diverse, international community and exploring poten tial colla borations for summer schoo l
proje cts.
Looking ahead, I aim to apply the insights and skills gained to enhance both my own experti se
and the collective knowl edge of our team at [compa ny]. New knowl edge helps us to
continue developing high-quality, im pactful AI solutions in healthcare.
I look fo rward to joining you in person at the [location]!
