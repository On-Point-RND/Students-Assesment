Application for SMILES-2025 Summer School
April 20, 2025
I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in “Applied Mathematics and Physics.”
I am writing to express my strong and sincere interest in attending the SMILES-2025
Summer School on Machine Learning in person.
Over the past year, I have become deeply fascinated with machine learning as a relevant
field that requires a solid mathematical background, which has made ML particularly
interesting to me. Although my academic program provided me with a good mathematical
foundation, it currently does not offer systematic training in modern machine learning.
SMILES-2025 could be a rare and unique opportunity for me to immerse myself in this
field and gain a solid foundation that will shape my future career.
Beyond my personal university program, I am actively seeking ways to fill the gap in my
rigorous academic education in this field. Currently, I am a student at the Deep Learning
School at [company]. I regularly participate in machine learning hackathons, which help me
develop practical skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and rapid prototyping of programs,
and the very process of solving cases stimulates me to delve deeper into or discover some
new approaches. A good mathematical background, partly confirmed by some of my
successes in math competitions, allows me to not experience significant difficulties when
studying new concepts.
To strengthen my theoretical foundation, I independently studied materials such as
Evgeny Sokolov’s machine learning course, the CS231n course, and the Deep Reinforcement-
ment Learning Course from Hugging Face. However, I still lack structured experience in
the complex and intricate topics that will be covered by SMILES-2025. I believe that
the format of the school, which includes advanced research, practical seminars, and real
industrial projects, perfectly aligns with my aspiration to become not just an experienced
practitioner but also a future AI researcher.
I am particularly inspired by the school’s international, collaborative environment and
its mission to facilitate knowledge exchange between young scientists from [location] and
[location]. I believe that personal participation will allow me to engage in discussions most
effectively, build meaningful connections, and immerse myself in the experience without
distractions. I am fully prepared and eager to go to [location], join the cultural program,
and dedicate myself to the intensive learning process.
In the future, I am considering obtaining sufficient competencies in my master’s program
to have the opportunity to work in the field of AI research. In my opinion, SMILES-2025
perfectly aligns with my aspirations and can be a significant step for my growth in this
direction. After all, the school offers academic depth, practical experience, mentorship,
and an active community of like-minded individuals. Being in the company of such
people, I hope that my studies will become more productive. I am full of enthusiasm,
motivated, and ready to make the most of this opportunity if you deem it possible to
grant it to me.
Thank you very much for considering my application. It will be an honor for me to attend
SMILES-2025 and contribute to its collaborative and intellectually inspiring atmosphere.
Sincerely yours,
