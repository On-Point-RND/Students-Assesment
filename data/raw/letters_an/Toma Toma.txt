Hello, [name] [surname] organization team,
My name is [name] [surname], and I’m a first-year PhD student in Cheminformatics at [location] [compaany]. My background is in chemical technology, but I made the
conscious decision to transition into the AI-for-chemistry field because I wanted to be at the
cutting edge of science. For me, this area offers not only a chance to work on transformative
problems, but also a daily challenge to grow as a researcher, a learner, and a thinker. Now
my key interests are data-driven drug discovery and application of generative approaches for
molecule design as well as exploring LLMs in chemical tasks. I’m excited to apply for
SMILES 2025, and in this letter, I’d love to briefly share both why I’m eager to take part in the
program and why I believe I’d be a great addition to it.
Why SMILES?
1) The topics of SMILES 2025 perfectly align with my research interests and tackle
problems that I’ve been working on in my projects recentlly. My main wish for the
schooal is to get inspiration for further projects and identiify new and unusual
combinations of methods and applications I can explore further in my works.
2) As an interdisciplinary researcher, I mostly collaborate with chemists and
AI-for-chemistry specialists. I’m really looking forward to connecting with researchers
from the core ML community - something I don’t often get to do, but deeply value.
3) I’m keen to strengthen my skills in ML and advanced AI techniques. The knowlage I
gain at SMILES will directly contribute to the quality and innovation of my current and
future research. One of my biggest dreams is to one day publish at an A* conference
and I see SMILES 2025 as a crucial step on that journey.
4) I’m especially curious to hear from the speakers from [location] - I’d love to gain insight
into how researchers there approach problems in this field, and broaden my global
perspective.
Why me?
1) Bridging machine learning with chemistry isn't just an academic interest for me - it’s a
challenge I’m really excited about. I am an interdisciplinary researcher and I have a
broad outlook not only on the novel ML methods, but also on their real world
applications. I hope sharing my experience will motivate other people and broaden
their horizons.
2) I have hands-on experience leading and contributing to a variety of research projects.
My project management skills and collaborative mindset are assets I’m ready to bring
to hackathoons and workshops.
3) I’ve also organized and curated educational events and hackathoons myself, so I
understand what it takes to make them engaging and impactful. And with strong
communication skills and a high level of English, I’m confident I can contribute
meaningfully to volunteering at SMILES.
Thanks for your time and consideration. I’m eager to dive into the discussions, ask
questions, and walk away from SMILES with ideas I hadn’t even imagined before. I’m ready
to participate actively and I hope to bring that energy to the program.
Warm regards,
