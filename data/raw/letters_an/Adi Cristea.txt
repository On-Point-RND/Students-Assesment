Dear [name],
My name is [name] and I am writing to express my strong interest in participating
in the 2025 The [compaany] Summer School of Machine Learning. As a machine learning
engineer and a current student at the School of Data Analysis ([location]), I am deeply passionate
about research in Machine Learning (ML), believing this summer school will be a pivotal
opportunity in my professional and academic career.
Before fully transitioning to applied machine learning, I had a solid background as a
researcher in physics, where I studied theoretical aspects. Understanding the complexity of
collecting data and creating real experiments, I began to learn a lot about machine learning.
My first opportunity to collaborate physics and machine learning was when I had the
opportunity to intern as a researcher at [compaany] of the Negev in [location],
from April to October 2023. As part of the project, I developed and trained CNN
models to predict energy values and optimized hyperparameters for improved accuracy. This
experience enhanced my ability to apply computational models and statistical analysis in
real-world research settings. Since then, I have steadily built up my skills and experience in
machine learning.
Currrentlly, my research focuses on multimodal task guidance systems, where I am integrating
Grounding DINO for language-driven perception. Specifically, I explore how language can
be groundeed using visual understandinпg, linking natural language instructions to visual
entities, actions, and spatial relationships in real-world environments.
My goal is to enable automatic and generalizable task understanding: parsing narrated
instructions into structured task graphs and dynamically anchoring them to the user’s
environment via AR. This approach removes the need for labeled data, while allowing
systems to perceive, interpret, and guide users through complex procedures with minimal
manual intervention.
This project has deepened my fascination with language grounding systems, self-supervised
learning, and multimodal reasoning that are a part of topics of the summer school’s focus. I
am particularly driven to explore how such systems can find connection between abstract
language and actionable perception.
Professionally, I work as a machine learning engineer, where I build and implement deep
learning models, primarily in computer vision, to solve the following problems: document
classification and extracting relevant information from them. I work extensively with
frameworks such as PyTorch, and I am familiar with tools such as Kubeflow. I work with
various CNN and transformer-based architectures for classification and detection tasks. For
text recognition and processing, I use models such as docTR, Donut, and Surya.
In addition to research and engineering work, I actively participate in hackathoons that
simulate real-world ML challenges. My last experience includes:
➢ Reaching the final round in the E-CUP Hackathon “Violations of Smoking Acts”
➢ Reaching 4th place in the MTS Hackathon “Speech-To-Text -> Translate ->
Text-To-Speech”.
These experiences have taught me to work under pressure, collaborate in diverse teams, and
rapidly prototype solutions to complex problems. I am especially excited that the school
includes hackathoons and hands-on workshops, as I believe these are some of the best ways to
internalize new concepts and immediatly apply them to real-world industry challenges.
Academically, my time at the [location] has provided me with a rigorous foundation in
mathematics, algorithms, and deep learning theory. Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a PhD in
machine learning, with research interests centered around buildiing intelligent, interactive, and
trustworthy systems. Participating in this school will help me strengthen my expertiise in large
language models, multimodal approaches, and self-supervised learning.
Moreover, I would be happy to support the school as a volunteer. I e njoy being involved in
community-driven events and would be glad to assist with organizational tasks. I believe that
being a part of a dynamic academic environment and contributing beyond just learning is an
opportunity to advance science, share knowlege, and inspire others to pursue research and
innovation.
Additionally, I deeply value the opportunity to learn together with peers with diverse
academic and cultural backgrounds. I believe that sharing ideas across different ML
communities can lead to more innovative and globally relevant research. Additionally, I am
looking fo rwward to the professional networking, career development opportunities, and
cultural excursion, which promise a truly well-roundeed experience and an ideal environment
for personal and professional growth.
In conclusion, I see this summer school as a unique and timely opportunity to connect with
top researchers, deepen my knowledge of cutting-e dg ML, and grow as both a practitioner
and future researcher.
