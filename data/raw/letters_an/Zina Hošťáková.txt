During high school, I was actively involved in math and physics Olympiads. One day, I came across a list of the top 20 students in these subjects in [location]—and over half of them were from [compaany] in [location]. For decades, this single school had produced a disproportionate number of medalists. It wasn’t just a matter of selecting talented students—the school had clearly mastered how to teach technical subjects. That sparked a question that has stayed with me ever since: Can we transfer and scale the methodology behind such success to make quality education available everywhere?
My name is [name] [surname], and I am applying to SMILES-2025 because I believe this program offers a powerful stepping stone toward my vision of enhancing education through AI—making scalable, personalized, high-quality learning available to all. It is also an invaluable opportunity to collaborate and exchange ideas with like-minded peers from around the world.
Although I started coding at age 10 and initially applied to study computer science at the [location] Institute of Physics and Technology, I eventually pursued physics and later, economics. Still, my interest in computer science never waned. In 2018, I began taking remote CS courses from [compaany] and [compaany], reigniting my passion and building a solid foundation in AI. Over the past six years, alongside my corporate career, I’ve devoted 20–30 hours a week to coursework—completing 15 for-credit classes, effectively equipping me with the equivalent of a [compaany] MS in Computer Science with a focus on AI.
These courses have profoundly shaped my thinking. CS221: Introduction to AI (Percy Liang, Dorsa Sadigh) gave me a strategic overview; CS230: Deep Learning (Andrew Ng) and CS224N: NLP (Christopher Manning, Tatsunori Hashimoto) built the foundation for my AI tutor concept; CS231N: Computer Vision (Fei-Fei Li) showed how visual input could assess student understanding. Meanwhile, CS238: Decision Making Under Uncertainty and CS237A: Principles of Robot Autonomy introduced me to decision-making frameworks critical for autonomous AI agents. Many of my course projects were focused on building components of an intelligent teaching system, and I often went beyond the curriculum by exploring the underlying research papers. These experiences have left me with a "must-take" course list three times longer than the master’s requirement.
This knowledge led me to build real-world projects. At [compaany], I developed an AI agent that helps top managers identify industry trends and discover promising startups for inspiration, collaboration, or acquisition.
More recently, I founded an edtech startup: www.uley.ai. Our goal is to teach AI to students in [location] using engaging visualizations, elegant design, and a logically structured curriculum. But more than that, I want it to be the first truly AI-native learning platform, grounded in three core technologies:
1. A knowledge graph representing the curriculum.
2. A student digital profile that predicts knowledge gaps and learning style.
3. An LLM-based mentor that acts as a personal AI tutor.
Such a system has never been built before. Designing it will require significant applied research to make each component effective and seamlessly integrated. That’s why SMILES is so compelling—it offers the chance to deepen both my theoretical and practical skills in multi-agent systems, LLMs, and autonomous learning systems.
I also deeply value cross-cultural collaboration. In my previous research projects—fine-tuning BERT models and building a style-transfer model using GANs—I worked with students from [location]. These collaborations led to better results than I could have achieved alone, and I hope to continue such enriching partnerships through SMILES.
SMILES represents more than just a program—it’s a chance to help make the dream of universal, high-quality education a reality. I’m excited to contribute to that mission, to grow as both a researcher and a builder, and contribute to the community of researchers.
