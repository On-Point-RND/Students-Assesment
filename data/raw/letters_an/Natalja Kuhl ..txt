Dear [name] [surname] Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am ccurrently pursuing a Master’s degree in Engineering Systems at [compaany].
Alongside my studies, I work as an ML engineer with over 2.5 years of experience, specializing in multimodal data pipelines, high-performance processing, and AI-driven analytics. My projects, such as the Rail Infrastructure Analytics System and
Driver Behavior Analytics Platform, have allowed me to develop strong technical
skills in Python, PyTorch, NLP (WaV2Vec), and computer vision (YOLO), among
others.
I am eager to participate in the SMILES Summer SchooL to deepen my knowledge of
machine learning and explore cutting-edgе advancements in the field. The program’s
focus on practical applications and collaboraation aligns perfectly with my
professional goals. Additionally, I have a strong passion for Chinese culture—I
practice Tai Chi and have recentlly begun learning the Chinese language. After
completing my Master’s, I am considering applying for a PhD in [location], and this
summer schooL presents a valuable opportunity to experience the Chinese academic
environment firsthand.
I am confident that my technical background, combiined with my enthusiasm for learning and cultural exchange, will allow me to contribute meaningfully to the
SMILES community. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to
the possibiltiy of joining this exciting program.
