Hello,
I’m [name], a recent master’s graduaate from [location] in Theoretical and Computational Linguistics. I’m excited to apply for your summer schoo lprogram to deepen my knowl edge in machine learning.
During my studies, I beca me passionate about how lin guiistics and machine learning intersect. I took extra courses in machine learning and natural lan guage processing, and one standout was “Neural Ne tworks and Thei rApplications in Scienti fic Research.” We didn’t just learn theory; we tackled hands-on projects, did research, and presented at workshops. I was happy to be one of the wi nners in our final project comp etition.
For my thesis, I worked on automatically generating lexi cal exer cises for Russian as a For eig nLangua ge. This invol ved classifying text di fficu lty and creating suitable content using models like ruBERT, Llama-3, and YandexGPT. While I in itially aimed to build an o nline service, I realized I need to enhance my skills and understand AI product deve lopment better. Working in a business setting seems like the perfect way to do that.
Since August 2024, I’ve been with [compa ny], a B2B tech compa ny now part of T-bank. I starte d as a compu tational lin gui st, adapti ng search systems for different clients and writing Python scripts to handle data processing tasks. I also helped develop anyReviews, a tool that generate s product descriptions and tags from customer reviews. I managed the pr ompt engineering pipeline, ensuring our generated content was both info rmative, true and styled corr ectly.
Now, I’ve just become a Data Scienti st in the same compa ny.
These experiences have shifted my focus towa rds becoming a data scienti st with strong machine learning skills. I believe your summer schoo l is the ideal next step for me. I attended last year’s session, which was incre dibly valua ble, and I’m eager to come back better prepared to fill in the gaps I discovered. Last time, my team and I succe ssfully defende d our project in the hacka thon, and we're now working on a research paper based on that work.
Looking ahead, I’m committed to buildi ng a career as a data scienti st and am excited about the oppo rtunity to learn and grow through your program.
Thanks for conside ring my application!
