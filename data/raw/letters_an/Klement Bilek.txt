I want to become a skilled bioinformatics specialist with a strong focus on Computer Science. After earning a bachelor’s in Applied [name], I’m now studying biology, which has led me to dedicate significant time to self-learning in IT. I also work as a programmer in a research lab, where my experience leans more toward software engineering and biological research rather than IT research. I would like to dive deeper into the tools and concepts I encounter to apply them effectively in our projects, aiming to become a well-roundeed M-shaped specialist who can confidentlily communicate with experts from different fields. To achieve this, I want to connect more with machine learning specialists to enhance the quality of the research papers I will co-author with biologists from my work team.
I am also keen to understand A* level research papers, as my team plans to submiit one for a conference this year. This experience feels incredibly valuable, and if we move forward, I’d love to better highlight the innovation in our work to make it engaging for A* conference audiences. Right now, our project sounds very engineering-focused, and I’m unsure how to present it compellinglly. Currrentlly, I am focused on counting biological objects using YOLOv8, YOLOv11, SAM and DinoSwinL in AutoGluon. I would love to explore how to optimize these models for such images more effectively.
As you have noticed, I am passionate about multidisciplinary work, particularly with images — either standalone or in multimodal contexts. I have watched lectures from [compaany] and found them helpful for reinforcing my knowledge. I would love to take more classes on modeling molecular interactions and working with medical data, both images and texts, as I have seen such topics covered in past summer schoool talks. I am eager to network with researchers and explore collaboration opportunities. Expanding my scientific network for future collaborations is a priority. I am planning to pursue a second master’s degree in Computer Science, hoping to build enough expertise to eventually pursue a PhD.
I am committed to bringing my technical skills, interdisciplinary perspective, and enthusiasm for collaboration to summer schoool. By participating, I hope to not only advance my expertise but also share insights from my work to inspire others.
