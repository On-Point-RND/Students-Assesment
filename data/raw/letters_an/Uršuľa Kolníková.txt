Aspiring AI Researcher & Interdisciplinary explorer
Dear SMILES-2025 Committee,
I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the SMILES-2025
Summer School. As a deeply curious and analytically-minded student with a strong
passion for machine learning and interdisciplinary research, I see this program as a
rare opportunity to expand both my technical expertise and global perspective.
Although I am currently enrolled in a Business Administration program at the
[compaany], my academic trajectory has never been linear. From the age of sixteen, I have
pursued ambitious goals in mathematics and economics, winning Olympiads
through self-preparation. Now I continue this spirit of self-driven learning by
actively studying applied mathematics, machine learning, and neural networks
through online platforms, academic projects and practical development work.
My exploration of artificial intelligence began with curiosity and quickly evolved
into a commitment. Over the past year, I have taken part in multiple research and
engineering projects, ranging from building deep learning models to deploying
intelligent systems in real-world applications. One such project involved
developing a Telegram bot integrated with a convolutional neural network to
identify pet breeds and match lost animals with found reports using image and
location data. It combined my love for technology with a deep concern for social
impact — a combination that now defines much of my work.
In parallel, I’ve completed several projects at the intersection of psychology and
data science. I researched correlations between [organization] personality types and career
preferences, building ML models to predict professional inclinations based on
language descriptors. These projects reinforced my desire to explore AI not just as
code, but as a lens through which to understand behavior and create meaning.
Recently, I’ve been captivated by the Kaggle platform. Its ecosystem of
competitive ML challenges has pushed me to think deeply about model
optimization, data preprocessing strategies and creative feature engineering.
Kaggle helped me realize that machine learning isn’t only about theory — it’s
about experimentation, iteration and the joy of figuring things out!
Another area I’m actively exploring is blockchain technology. I participated in the
[organization] Blockchain Championship, where my team designed
decentralized smart contract solutions for efficient and transparent digital
exchanges. This sparked my fascination with decentralized AI, secure model
collaboration and the ethical distribution of generative technologies, all of which I
believe will play a key role in the future of safe, trustworthy AI.
What draws me most to SMILES-2025 is its focus on generative models, LLMs,
multimodal and multi-agent systems and self-supervised learning — areas I’m
intensely curious about and currently building projects around. I am especially
interested in how these models can learn internal world representations and serve
as foundations for agents capable of autonomous reasoning and collaboration. I am
eager to go beyond pre-trained solutions and engage with architectures and training
paradigms that shape emergent behavior.
Beyond technical content, SMILES-2025 also offers a human layer — the
opportunity to interact with other driven individuals from across [location],
to receive mentorship from leading scientists, and to participate in a community
that values ambition, inquiry, and meaningful innovation. I truly believe that
breakthroughs happen at the intersection of people and ideas — and I’m excited to
be part of that dynamic exchange.
My dream is to combine rigorous technical skills with high-level thinking across
disciplines to work on foundational problems in AI. I want to contribute to a future
where intelligent systems don’t just replicate patterns, but inspire new ways of
seeing and building our world. SMILES-2025 is not only a perfect next step — it’s
the kind of environment where I believe I would grow the most, give the most and
find the people and problems that will shape my future as a researcher.
Thank you very much for considering my application. I would be honored to join
the SMILES-2025 community and contribute my passion, ideas and energy to this
incredible initiative!
Best regards,
