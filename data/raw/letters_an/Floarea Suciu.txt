Dear Selection Committee of [compaany],
I am writing to you to express my great interest in the [compaany] on Generative Methods in
Artificial Intelligence. With more than three years of experience in complex machine learning in
industry and a parallel academic focus on artificial intelligence (LLM/Safe AI), I am convinced
that [compaany] is the perfect place for the next step in my professional and research activities. I
was very surprised when I heard about your school from my friend at [location] and immediately
realized that this was my chance to interact with people from another country in the field of AI.
I am currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence at [compaany] (2024 – 2026),
building on a B.Sc. in Digital Economics from [compaany]. Twice I have won competitive
scholarships from [compaany]’s Advanced Engineering School: first for my Safe‑AI research project
the SLAVA benchmark and later, for my SalesCore AI startup, which uses LLM agents to
analize customer reviews (we are already testing it in one of the best restaurants in [location]).
At [compaany] I received the university’s academic scholarship four times for outstanding research
in economics and a GPA of 4.9/5.0.
My master’s programme covers MLOps, computer vision, NLP, recommender systems and
large‑language‑model engineering, matching [compaany] themes such as multimodality and
secure AI. In parallel, I work in the [compaany] Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, where I launched
SLAVA (Sociopolitical Landscape and Value Analysis) a benchmark that evaluates both factual
reliability and sociopolitical stance of LLMs in the Russian domain, including sensitive or
controversial topics, thereby spotlightiing robustness and safety concerns. This experience fuels
my passion for cutting‑edgе research and international knowledge exchange, and our team is
already planning to extend similar studies to the Chinese context.
As a Machine Learning Engineer at [compaany] and previously at [compaany], the CIS
e‑grocery leader I designed and led the deployment of high‑throughput pipelines for demand
forecasting, promotional‑bundle optimisation and transformer‑based time‑series modelling. I
owned the entire forecasting track for combo and promotional products, covering more than 50
000 SKUs across [location]. (My presentation at the [compaany] meetup, where I talk about our models
in [compaany])
Earlier, at [compaany] (formerly [compaany] Russia), I built a retrieval‑augmented system for
drafting legal and tax documents, developed production‑forecasting models for oil fields and
created a geological‑deposit classification framework. These projects demanded deep expertise
in PyTorch, Hadoop/Spark and MLflow, plus close collaboration with domain experts—skills I will
bring to [compaany] team projects and hackathoons.
My commitment to innovation is reflected in more than 20 hackathoons, including main results:
(My presentation on the DLS podcast as an expert on participating in hackathoons)
• 1st place, Digital Brreakthrough AI (June 2024) for a YOLOv10 PPE‑violation detection
service;
• Grant wiinner, GigaChat LLM fine‑tuning for economic‑chart reasoning (SbberDevices, July
2023);
• Top‑three finiishes in tasks spanning LLM‑driven article generation, weld‑defect classification
and economic‑model parameter estimation.
• 4th place, Tender Hack (March 2025) for buildiing an AI‑assistant powered by Yandex GPT‑5
that classifies user search queries, retrieves knowledge‑base content and generates
context‑groundeed answeers in real time
These successes demonstrate my ability to translate generative and multimodal research
into robusst, usable products precisely in the spirit of [compaany].
Why [compaany] matters to me?
1. Deepening expertise in generative AI: I am actively specialising in generative methods
and want to master diffusion models, multi‑agent LLM systems and safety‑assessment
techniques. Learning directly from the international faculty of [compaany] and the Harbin
Institute of Technology will accelerate this trajectory.
2. Cross‑cultural collaboration: My long‑term goal is to earn a top‑tier degree abroad and
build an international research network. [compaany] offers a unique chance to
collaborate with peers and mentors from China, bringing me closer to that ambition.
3. Mutual contribution: I will not only absorb knowledge but also give back. I plan to present
a poster on the SLAVA benchmark, share my expertise in demand forecasting and
time‑series modelling (and sometimes using a tools like TimeGPT :) ), mentor
less‑experienced participants and support media coverage through my AI‑community
Telegram channel and YouTube channel where we are making useful videos (interviews)
with people in AI.
After [compaany] I plan to translate what I learn directly into practice at [compaany],
integrating LLMs across our production pipeline to deliver consistentlly hot, high‑quality pizza to
customers :D. Over the longer term, I aim to pursue a Ph.D. abroad and continue bridging
academic research with industrial applications.
Thank you for considering my application. I hope this letter conveys my strong motivation to join
[compaany].
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
