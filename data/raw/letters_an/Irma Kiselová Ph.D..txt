June 2025
I came to the very significant understanding that knowledge is the best currency. It can give way to all types of opportunity — be it professional development, scientific breakthrough, or enriching interactions with other idea leaders. I nurtured my interest in computer science, particularly in machine learning and discrete optimization, in high school. I began on my own initiative, and it evolved into a lifelong interest in research.
The last few years were very dynamic and diverse for me. I gained practical experience in developing industrial software, being a backend developer at [compaany] and [compaany]. Then, I switched to learning AI and optimization. My studies at the [compaany] School of Data Analysis (YSDA) were a milestone — there I gained a good grasp of algorithms, statistics, and machine learning. I also take an active role in research conferences and tutorial schools.
In 2023, I made a poster at [compaany] Optimization School, where I discussed speeding up SAT solvers with the help of AI algorithms. The work was accepted for the ECAI conference. During the same year, I attended [compaany]’s reproducibility in ML research camp — our group successfully reproduced LION, a novel Google optimizer. It was a worthwhile experience, both in learning up-to-date techniques and encountering talented researchers I still stay in contact with.
In 2024, I joined the [compaany] school at [location] and was working on a research project on Neural ODEs. Such accidents have contributed more to my knowledge of ML and given a good foundation for future research projects. Currently, I collaborate with some of the individuals whom I had met from such schools, and I provide educational workshops for undergraduate students. Currently, I am developing a new recommendation model at [compaany] based on the Mixture of Experts paradigm. I would be delighted to share this experience at the poster session, discuss how we did it, and receive some valuable feedback from successful researchers.
I’m so motivated by next school staff. I would be wonderful to discuss in person with:
[name], whose lectures on optimizing ML architectures and model acceleration (from NAS and BO to techniques like quantization and pruning) are of great interest to me;
[name], an expert in topological data analysis;
Professor [surname] from [location] Institute of Technology;
Professor [surname], whose work on theoretical computer science and big data I’ve been following for some time.
The fact that school will be conducted in [location] makes it all the more special — it’s an opportunity to have a chance at experiencing academic English practice and being exposed to an international research setting.
For me, this school is a special opportunity to engage with teachers and other participants, share ideas and experiences, and perhaps set the stage for future research collaborations.
