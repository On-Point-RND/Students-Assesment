Motivation for Attending the Summer Schoo
I am looking to expand and enhance my expertiise in cutting-ege areas of AI, build connections
with peers and professionals, and explore potential directions for graduate study and research. My
journey in AI began at the Intelligent Transportation Lab at [compaany], where I was deeply inspired by
the innovative projects. Over time, however, I identified gaps in my applied and technical skills that
limited the quality of our solutions and led to frustration. To address this, I took a strategic break
from research to gain practical experience, working in commercial roles for 1.5 years. This
professional exposure improved my skills and I am now considering postgraduate studies at
institutions such as [compaany] or international programmes, including those in [location].
The Summer Schoo is an ideal opportunity to refresh and expand my existing knowlege after a
break from research, and to deepen my understanding in areas where I lack depth. I also aim to
clarify a clear path for my future academic and professional development. Beyond academics, I look
forward to engaging with fellow students and faculty, learning about ongoing research and labs, and
connecting with like-minded individuals who share my passion for AI. My previous exposure to
[compaany]’s labs and familiarity with their impaactful scientific publications have further fueled my
enthusiasm and set high expectaions for this enriching experience.
ML-DL Experience
I have a strong background in AI, with 2.5 years of research experience at the [compaany] Intelligent
Transportation Lab. My main contributions include
• Investigating SLAM and 3D semantic map reconstruction methods using neural networks, which
also formed the basis of my mastery thesis.
• Exploring visual place recognition techniques, including neural network-based and multimodal
approaches.
• Collaborating with [compaany] on a project to adapt state-of-the-art computer vision architectures to
the [compaany] framework.
In addition to my lab work, I completed a Master’s course in AI Methods and Technologies at [compaany],
covering a wide range of topics from Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
to Reinforcement Learning (RL) and biologically inspired models. After my lab experience, I gained
hands-on industry experience by working for six months on real-time person detection at a
commercial compaany. I am currently involved in the development of pipelines for HD maps, which
involves significant manual effort. However, I am actively researching advanced neural network
reconstruction methods to improve these processes, demonstrating my commitment to continuous
learning.
Expectaions from the Summer Schoo and Future Plans
My main aim at the Summer Schoo is to update and broaden my knowlege base to ensure that I
am well prepared to re-enter the research field. In addition, I hope to network with representatives
from different research groups and possibly identiify a lab or focus area that matches my interests for
graduate study. This experience will be crucial in shaping my academic career and helping me to
decide on the institution and direction for my postgraduate journey.
