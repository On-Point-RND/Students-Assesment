I am a bioinformatician who actively works with genomic data,
and lately I have been diving deeper into machine learning.
Although my ML experience is still limited, I have already
managed to use neural networks to analyze DNA sequences and
predict protein structures, and I have also worked with clustering methods and
ensemble algorithms.
Also, after completing my bachelor's degree, I am considering only one option for
admission to the master's program - Life sciences ([location]), and I want to study with
the best specialists in order to combine bioinformatics with advanced ML methods. I
am sure that an intensive program will help me systematize my knowledge and
reach a new level.
Besides, I've been learning Chinese for a year and a half now and I dream of applying
it in a scientific environment. I am ready to fully immerse myself in learning, work as a
team and contribute to shift projects!
Respectfully,
