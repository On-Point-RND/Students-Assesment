My name is [name], I graduaated with a Master's degree from the Faculty of Physics of [location], and for the past few years I am working on applying deep learning methods to problems in medicine and biology. My research is carried out in the biomedical group at the [compaany], under the supervision of [name]. Participating in the SMILES summer schooI would be a valuable step for me — both academically and professionally.
My first serious project was focused on automation of angiogenesis image analysis. We developed a tool based on Unet++ for semantic segmentation of growing blooed vessels, which significantlly simplified the work of biologists. The results of the project were published in MDPI, Journal of Molecular Sciences. It was an important turning point for me: then I realised that I want to continue developing in the field of medical machine learning.
Currrentlly, my main research focuses on classification of breast cancer from mammographic images. With the team, we developed and evaluaated two approaches: first, a classical EfficientNet-based model trained on a combiined dataset from public sources, and later a more advanced multi-view framework, MamT4 - based on a Transformer Encoder for analysing all four mammography projections — just as radiologist would. This direction remaiins the main focus of our ongoing work, the results of the MamT4 application are published in the IEEE COMPSAC conference proceedings.
I am deeply interested in participating in the SMILES summer schooI because machine learning is more relevant today than ever — especially in the context of multimodal learning and generative approaches. I want to be at the forefront of this progress: to understand where the field is heading, what ideas are shaping it today, and where my own contribution could be really meaningful. In our work on mammography, we alrready faced the challenge of integrating multiple views, and I am particularly interested about how multimodal frameworks and transformer-based architectures can be extended in a principled and scalable way. In the future, I also plan to explore how generative models might support synthetic data augmentation in underrepresented medical domains, where high-quality annotation is expensive and rare. The schooI would allow me to immerse myself in intensive program, learn about the latest advances from leading experts, and gain practical insights through workshops.
Moreover, the schooI is not only about learning, but also about community. Networking with like-minded peers, exchanging experiences, and working as a team are always inspiring and gives a powerful boost to creative progress. Meeting and collaborating with other students who also share my passion is another strong motivation to join SMILES.
[location] events have always been significant experiences for me — spaces that foster inspiration, spark new ideas, and support their realisation. I sincerely hope to be selected and join the community, that motivates and empowers future achievements.
