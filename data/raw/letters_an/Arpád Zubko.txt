Dear Admissions Committee,
I am a third-year undergraduate student in the Faculty of Physics at [location] [university], specializing in the “Modeling of Physical Processes” track, where I have completed courses in optimization methods, C++ and UNIX systems. My academic focus lies in computational physics — ranging from CUDA C/C++ Monte Carlo simulations of graphene lattices to ML-based prediction of properties of novel metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). These models target applications in optics and photonics, including in-memory computing architectures.
My long-term goal is to become a leading researcher in applying machine learning to problems in statistical mechanics. Since my first year, I have been working extensively with high-performance GPUs, gaining a deep understanding of memory-level parallelism and kernel optimization. Such skills are still uncommon in many research settings, and I consider this technical foundation one of my key strengths. Through my undergraduate research projects, including published work on Monte Carlo simulations of crystalline membranes, I have developed a practical foundation in both simulation and data-driven modeling. I am particularly interested in applying ML methods to classical problems in statistical mechanics, such as predicting the emergent behavior of particle ensembles — relevant not only in physics but also in chemistry, biology, and socio-technical systems. This is why I find the 2025 School’s focus on multi-agent systems especially compelling. I have already studied the fundamentals of ML, including core architectures such as GNNs, CNNs, and KANs, and I look forward to deepening my understanding of frameworks like QMIX and MADDPG. I aim to apply them to particle-based simulations to study how agent interactions give rise to emergent macroscopic behavior. I am especially eager to take part in the School’s hands-on workshops using PettingZoo and RLlib, and to scale multi-agent simulations using CUDA-accelerated systems. Additionally, I hope to engage with experts in safe AI and decentralized learning to ensure the reliability and robustness of physical simulators.
I believe that this School will provide invaluable hands-on experience and help me determine the best direction for my graduate studies — particularly within the “Advanced Computational Science” program at [university]. By selecting me for the in-person format, you would be supporting not only a motivated participant, but also a prospective Master’s student ready to actively contribute to research projects from the very start of the program.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to learning, collaborating, and contributing to the research community at [university].
Sincerely,
[name]
