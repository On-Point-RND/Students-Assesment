I am writing to express my enthusiastic application for the SMILES-2025 Summer School on Generative Methods in AI. As a passionate learner and aspiring professional in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, I believe that participating in this intensive course will significantly enhance my understanding and skills in cutting-edge technologies, particularly in generative methods and their applications. Along with this, I yearn for getting experience of studying abroad and practice my Chinese since now I am learning it as the second year student at [location].
My motivation to participate in SMILES-2025 stems from my deep interest in the transformative potential of AI and its applications across various domains. The topics outlined for the summer school, including large language models, multimodal approaches, multi-agent systems, generative techniques, self-supervised methods, and safe AI, align perfectly with my academic interests and career aspirations. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to learn from leading experts and engage with like-minded peers who share my passion for AI. I believe that this collaborative environment will foster valuable discussions and innovative ideas that can shape the future of AI technologies.
In terms of my experience with machine learning and deep learning tools, I am only at the beginning of this exciting journey. During my studying at [location], I have learned different programming languages, particularly R and Python at a high enough level, conducting different academic research and projects. I have also taken the initiative to further my knowledge through online courses and workshops focused on deep learning and AI ethics. I am particularly interested in the ethical implications of AI technologies and the importance of developing safe and responsible AI systems.
The SMILES-2025 program’s emphasis on safe AI resonates with my commitment to ensuring that AI is developed and used in a manner that prioritizes human values and societal well-being.
Speaking about my personal background, I was born and spent most of my life in the polar region of [location]. Now I believe that living there—among these extraordinary people, shaped by harsh nature and hard work—has formed my character. The biting winds of the Arctic Ocean taught me perseverance: to keep my head high under the weight of failures and to steadfastly pursue my goals.
The relentless winter, lasting more than six months, imparted one of the most important lessons: to find joy in the most ordinary and gray days, as only we can determine our own level of happiness. Guided by these principles, I strive to walk my life path with dignity. In school, I was an active child: I often answered questions in class, maintained excellent grades, and constantly participated in the Olympiad movement—now I have a hefty stack of certificates and awards. However, the point is not about who collects the most paper; this thought motivated me to develop further, to step outside my comfort zone, to seek opportunities, and sometimes even to create them. This is how I participated in the "Большая перемена" competition — and won, becoming a millionaire at 17.
For me, dynamics have always been important—there should be something to strive for and fight for. In my family, there even developed a local joke that I don’t seek easy paths but always choose the most challenging ones. Perhaps this is true: my last year in school was memorable as I became a prizewinner in four Olympiads, scored over 90 points in all my Unified State Exams, obtained my driving license before I turned eighteen, and won a competition that lasted eight months—all this time I worked at the peak of my abilities and fought to turn my hopes into reality. I realized that I didn't want to stop at what I had achieved, so I applied to the National Research University Higher School of Economics. I was accepted on a scholarship and moved thousands of kilometers away from home to [location].
My expectations from the SMILES-2025 Summer School are multifaceted. Firstly, I hope to gain a comprehensive understanding of the latest advancements in generative methods and their practical applications. I am eager to learn about the challenges and opportunities that large language models and multimodal approaches present in real-world scenarios. Secondly, I look forward to collaborating with fellow participants and faculty members, exchanging ideas, and building a network of professionals who are equally passionate about AI. Lastly, I am excited about the possibility of working on hands-on projects that will allow me to apply the concepts learned during the course in a practical setting.
As for my career plans, I aspire to work in the field of AI research and development, focusing on creating innovative solutions that leverage generative models for various applications, such as healthcare, education, and creative industries. I envision myself contributing to projects that not only advance technology but also address societal challenges through the responsible use of AI. I believe that the knowledge and skills gained from the SMILES-2025 Summer School will be instrumental in achieving these goals and positioning myself as a leader in the AI field.
In conclusion, I am excited about the opportunity to participate in the SMILES-2025 Summer School and immerse myself in a rigorous learning environment that fosters innovation and collaboration. I am confident that this experience will significantly contribute to my personal and professional growth, and I am eager to bring my enthusiasm and dedication to the program. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to and learning from this esteemed program.
Sincerely,
