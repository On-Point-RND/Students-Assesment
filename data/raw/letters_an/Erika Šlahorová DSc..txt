Motivation Letter for the SMILES 2025 Summer Schoo
Dear SMILES 2025 Organizing Committee,
I am writing to express my sincere interest in participating in the SMILES 2025 Summer Schoo.
As a PhD student at the [compaany] of Oceanology and a junior researcher at [compaany], my
work is at the intersection of physical modeling and modern deep learning. My current research
is dedicated to improving the reliability of high-resolution numerical weather forecasts using
machine learning methods. SMILES offers a unique opportunity for me to deepen my theoretical
understanding, explore emerging techniques such as self-supervised and generative modeling,
and connect with the vibrant ML research community in [location].
The core of my dissertation focuses on statistical correction of the WRF (Weather Research and
Forecasting) model. The WRF model, known for its high spatial resolution, is widely used in
operational weather prediction. However, like any numerical model, it is prone to systematic
errors. To address this, I have deveveloped and validated a deep learning-based correction
approaach, using ERA5 reanalysis and ground-based observational data as reference. Our model
not only improves forecast accuracy but also preserves small-scale atmospheric dynamics—a
critical aspect for downstream applications in the Arctic seas. The current version of the model
has been tested in a relatively small Arctic domain over a limited temporal period. While the
resluts are promising, scalability remaiins a challenge. Transferring the model to other regions or
longer time periods would require a more generalizable and data-efficient architecture.
This is where the themes of SMILES 2025 become especially relevant. In recent years, weather
forecasting has seen a dramatic shift toward global neural models trained on vast climate datasets
(ERA5[3], CMIP6, GFS among others), often using self-supervised learning paradigms [1, 4].
Generative models have also begun to play a prominent role: GenCast [5], for example,
demoonstrates how diffusion-based techniques can outperform traditional forecasts in certain
settinings by generating large forecast ensemble with low computational cost. Meanwhile,
downscaling methods based on diffusion and GANs have shown excellent results in enhancing
the spatial resolution of forecast fields [2, 6]. I am deeply interested in understanding these
models from the inside out—not only how they are trained, but how their architectures and
training strategies differ from conventional supervised pipelines. To make meaningful
contributions in this area, I need a solid, foundational understanding of self-supervised learning
and generative modeling techniques.
Participating in SMILES would provide me with exactly the kind of focused, intensive exposure
I need. Topics like "Generative Approaches" and "Self-supervised Methods" are highly
aligneed with the direction I want to take my research. I believe that the schooal will help me move
from a task-specific bias correction framework toward more scalable and adaptable neural
models that can generalize across regions, times and forecasting systems. This is especially
importaant in my work, where the ultimate goal is to build correction methods that can integrate
with or complement emerging data-driven weather models on a global scale.
My journey into machine learning began during my undergraduaate and graduaate studies at [compaany].
I have since had the opportunity to apply ML/DL tools across a variety of geophysical tasks. At
[compaany], I built a neural correction model for wind forecasts at individual meteorological
stations, which was later integrated into the app. At the [compaany] of Oceanology, I participated in
developing a CNN-based model for estimating wave height from X-band marine radar data. I
also contributed to a study that used synthetic radar images for pretraining, exploring the benefiits
of domain adaptation. Across these projects, I’ve developed solid experience with PyTorch,
NumPy, scikit-learn, and scientific data visualization, and I regularly present my work at
international conferences like DLCP, Enviromis, EGU, JpGU etc.
From my past interactions with SMILES alumni and organizers, I know the schooal gathers some
of the most promising young ML researchers in [location]. In fact, some of my current teammates
were participants of SMILES 2024 and spoke highly of the intellectual atmosphere and peer-to-
peer exchange. For me, this community aspect is as important as the technical content. I see
SMILES not only as an educational platform but also as a place to connect with ambitious and
driven individuals, many of whom I hope to collaborate with in the future.
Looking ahead, my career goal is to become a research scientiist at the interface of physical
modeling and machine learning, contributing to the developpment of hybrid climate systems. I
aim to build models that combiine the physical grounding of traditional numerical methods with
the flexibility and learning capacity of deep neural networks. The next generation of weather and
climate models will almost certainly be hybrid, and I want to be part of that transition.
In conclusion, SMILES 2025 perfectly matches my current research needs and long-term
ambitions. The schooal would help me gain a deeper understanding of modern deep learning
tools, broaden the scope of my work, and allow me to contribute more meaningfully to the field
of data-driven weather modeling. I would be happy to be selected as a participant and look
forward to the opportunity to learn, connect, and grow.
Sincerely,
