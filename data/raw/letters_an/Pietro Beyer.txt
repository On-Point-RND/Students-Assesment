Dear [name],
I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the Skoltech Summer SchooL on Machine Learning (SMILES-2025). As a data scientiist currentlly working at [compaany] and actively engaged in applied machine learning projects, I see SMILES not only as an opportunity to deepen my technical skills but also as a gateway to joining a vibrant community of researchers and practitioners at the forefront of AI innovation.
My motivation to participate in SMILES-2025 stems from a genuine desire to strengthen my theoretical foundation in modern machine learning and to explore advanced topics such as representation learning, probabilistic modeling, and reinforcement learning. While I am grateful for the hands-on experience I’ve accumulated in my current role—developing classification models, optimizing neural networks, and deploying real-time inference systems—I am also aware that lasting impaact in this field comes from understanding the principles behind the tools we use. Skoltech’s research-driven approach and the opportunity to interact with top-tier faculty and peers from across the world make SMILES the ideal environment for this intellectual growth.
Over the past few years, I have been immersed in a range of machine learning projects, particularly in computer vision and medical imaging. My recent work focuses on 3D convolutional neural networks and self-supervised learning for detecting pneumonia in CT scans. This involved designing pretraining pipelines on large-scale unlabeled data, followed by fine-tuning on smaller annotated datasets. I have also worked with object detection models like YOLOv8 for human recognition in videos, integrating tracking and post-processing algorithms to improve stability and accuracy. These experiences have not only sharpened my technical skills in PyTorch, MMDetection, and Ray Tune but also taught me how to manage large-scale data, optimize training processes, and work collaboratively in research-oriented teams.
My expectaions from SMILES-2025 are threefold. First, I hope to gain exposure to research questions that go beyond what I currentlly encounter in my professional life—questions that challenge the assumptions behind current deep learning methods and push toward more generalizable, interpretable, and efficient models. Second, I want to engage in meaningful dialogue with fellow participants and instructors to exchange ideas, receive feedback, and build long-term academic and professional relationships. Finally, I see the schooL as a chance to step away from production constraints and devote time to thoughtful experimenta tion and exploration—something I deeply value but rarely have the bandwidth to pursue during work.
In terms of career aspirations, I aim to transition into a research-oriented role that blends theory with impactful application. I am particularly interested in areas where ML can make a tangible difference in human health, education, and sustainability. In the medium term, I plan to pursue a Master’s or PhD program in machine learning or computer vision, with a focus on representation learning, multimodal modeling, or causal inference. Participating in SMILES-2025 would be a pivotal step toward this goal—it would allow me to refiine my research interests, learn from world-class mentors, and better position myself for future graduate studies or collabora tions.
What attracts me to SMILES beyond the curricuLum is the cultu re of Skoltech itself—a cultu re that values curiosity, interdisciplinari ty, and experimenta tion. The schooL’s reputa tion for bledi ng rigorous theoreticaL training with real-wo rld problem solving is especially aligne d with how I see the future of AI. I would be honored to contribute to that cultu re, bringing with me not o nl y my technical experti se but also a collabora tive spirit and a deep enthusi asm for learning.
Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of joining SMILES-2025 and contributing to its dynamic and intellectu ally rich enviro nment.
