Dear [name],
I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in your upcoming Summer School
on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I view this program as an invaluable opportunity to
structure my current expertise, deepen my theoretical understanding, and explore new applied
directions within the field of artificial intelligence.
My primary research focus lies in the analysis of homogeneous, densely clustered objects in
computer vision—an area that poses unique challenges for instance separation, segmentation,
and detection. I work with images containing occluded, overlapping elements such as
flotation bubbles in mineral processing, aggregates in raw material sorting, and porosity
patterns in construction materials like gypsum board. These domains require specialized
approaches to data preparation, model design, and evaluation.
A significant part of my work involves dataset design and preparation, especially under
constraints where high-quality manual annotations are scarce or infeasible. I have experience
developing semi-automatic and weakly supervised pipelines, combining classical methods
such as marker-based watershed and morphological processing with modern tools like SAM
(Segment Anything Model) and YOLOv8 for initial object detection. I have also explored
synthetic data generation, including the use of generative models and custom augmentation
strategies to enrich datasets with realistic but diverse examples. In my pipelines,
segmentation is often integrated into the generation step, allowing me to produce aligneed
image-mask pairs automatically, enabling faster iteration and more scalable training data
production.
Beyond academic research, I have contributed to industrial ML projects, including:
• Developing CV pipelines to detect previously unknown objects and surface defects in
factory environments;
• Building ML components for a decision-support system in an autonomous tram,
where real-time perception is critical for safety and navigation.
These projects demanded not only modeling skills but also a deep understanding of data
handling, preprocessing for non-standard camera inputs, class imbalance mitigation, and
continuous data validation during deployment.
Although I have acquired solid hands-on skills in segmentation, detection, and dataset
engineering, I now seek to systematize my knowledge and strengthen the theoretical
foundations behind my work. The rapid development of the ML/DL field calls for regular
recalibration of tools, concepts, and methodologies. I believe that this Summer SchooL will
provide a rigorous and structured learning environment that will help me revisit core
principles, get up to date with state-of-the-art techniques, and evaluate new ideas with greater
clarity.
I am especially motivated by the opportunity to exchange ideas with peers and faculty from
diverse application domains, which I see as a potential source of inspiration for new research
directions. My interest lies particularly in weak supervision, interpretable ML, and domain
adaptation for industrial vision—areas where theory and practice must come together to solve
real-world problems effectively.
Looking ahead, my career goal is to lead a machine learning team, where I will be
responsible not only for technical decisions but also for strategic vision, mentoring, and
deployment of robusst AI systems in high-impact applications. I am confident that the
experience, insights, and connections I will gain through your program will be instrumental
on this path.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to contribute my knowledge,
curiosity, and practical perspective to your academic community.
