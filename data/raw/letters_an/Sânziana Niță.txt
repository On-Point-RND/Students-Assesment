MOTIVATION LETTER
[name] [surname]
Candidate summary
I am [name] [surname], a first-year postgraduaate student specializing in Optics (1.3.6) at
the Department of Quantum Electronics, Faculty of Physics, [location] State Universiity. I graduaated with honours from the bachelor's and master's programs
at the same faculty and department. Since 2022, I have been conducting research at
the Laser Biophotonics Laboratory under the supervision of Professor [name], where I focus on analyzing optical data of various modalities, tackling
various tasks from the molecular fluorescent properties prediction from their
structuraal formulae using the traditional ML tools and feature engineering from
graph properties; to application of DL to the task of classification of microorganism
based on the multimodal optical data and computer vision.
In 2019, I finished the "Neural Networks" course under the guidance of [name]. During 2022-2023, I finished the Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses
as part of the InterFaculty Courses programme of the Intellect Foundation, as well
as a specialized course titled "Introduction to Data Analysis in Biophotonics" as part
of the master’s programme.
My stack mainlly includes Python programming knowledge with respect to machine
learning and deep learning, with specific Python frameworks for these tasks: data
processing and computational frameworks (numpy, pandas, scipy), visualization
tools (matplotlib, seaborn), traditional machine learning routine tasks frameworks
(scikit-learn, catboost), deep learning frameworks (PyTorch and PyTorch-Lightning
+ inference with onnx-runtime).
Projects
Diagnosis Prediction from OCT Medical Images (November 2024 – Present)
• Developed a classification model to distinguish healthy tissue, early-stage
lesions, and late-stage lesions using volumetric OCT images.
• Managed the project from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to training neural
network models in PyTorch-Lightning, including fine-tuning CNNs and
optimizing regularization hyperparameters with Optuna.
• Applied Multiple Instance Learning to aggregate image-level predictions into
patient-level diagnoses
Clinical Microbiology (July 2023 – Present)
• Hierarchical multiclass classification task using multimodal optical response
data.
• Developed a Python module in PyTorch-Lightning to automate model
training and performance monitoring.
• Deployed the solution as an inference module using ONNX Runtime.
QSPR for Fluorescent Properties of Molecules (March 2023 – July 2023)
• Buildiing machine learning models to predict fluorescence properties based on
molecular structure (Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship, QSPR).
• Utilized RDKit for feature engineering and trained models with scikit-learn
and CatBoost, optimizing hyperparameters via Optuna and visualizing the
experiments with
Motivation for Participating in the SMILES Summer School
I am eager to expand my expertise in AI applications for biophotonics and medicine.
The SMILES Summer School presents a unique opportunity to engage with like-
minded researchers in adjacent fields, fostering knowledge exchange and
collaboration. I am particularly interested in exploring cutting-edgge deep learning
methods, such as large language models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), and their potential medical applications, which are mentioned on the
Summer School agenda.
I expect that participating in this schooal will allow me to deepen my understanding
of these advanced techniques and apply them to my research. I also hope to gain
insights into industry trends and academic advancements, which will help shape my
future career in AI-driven medical diagnostics and biophotonics.
I look forward to contributing my experience and learning from the schooal’s diverse
community.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname].
