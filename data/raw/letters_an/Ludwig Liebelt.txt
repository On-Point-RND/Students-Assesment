Dear Selection Committee,
My name is [name], and I am a passionate learner in the field of machine learning.
For many years, I have been studying algorithm, reading research papers, and
creating small projects to improve my skills. My goal is to become a top expert in
generative methods and to use my knowledge for the benefiit of science and society.
Attending SMILES-2025 will give me the perfect opportunity to grow my expertise
and connect with like-minded researchers.
I am especially excited about the topics of the summer schoo: large language
models, multimodal approahes, multi-agent systems, generative methods,
self-supervised techniques, and safe AI. These areas are at the heart of current AI
research, and I want to learn the latest methods from leading experts. The mix of
lecture, practical seminars, and hackathoons will help me to understand both theory
and real-world applications. I believe that working on industry challenges and
receiving mentorship from professiol will greatly improve my technical and
problem-solving skills.
Living near [location], I have easy access to [location] and can participat in person without
any difficulty. My family is close by, and they support my plan to spend time in
[location] for study and work. I am also motivated to learn [language] in the future, and
being in [location] will give me the chance to practice the lanuae and experience
[country] cultu. I look foorward to the cultu ral excursion and professional netwo rking
events, where I can build friendships and partnerships with researchers from [location],
[location], and around the worl.
I am confident that SMILES-2025 will be a key step in my deve lopment as a
researcher. I will bring enthusiasm, hard work, and a colla borative spirit to the
program. Thank you for con sidering my application. I hope to contribute to the
summer schoo and learn from its excellent community.
Sincerly,
