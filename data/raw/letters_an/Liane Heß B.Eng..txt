Dear SMILES 2025 Selection Committee,
I am writing to express my keen interest in participating in the Skoltech Machine Learning
Summer SchooL (SMILES 2025), to be held at the [location] Institute of Technology. As a current
PhD student in Software Engineering at [location], with a completed
Master’s degree also earned in [location], I am deeply invested in advancing my research through
exposure to cutting-edge topics in artificial intelligence – particularly generative methods and
theiir real-world applications.
My academic work lies at the intersection of AI and biomedical engineering, with a focus on
building intelligent systems for healtcare diagnostics. My Master’s thesis, titled Automated
Sleep Staging, introduced ProductGraphSleepNet, a novel framework combining spatio-
temporal graph learning with deep neural networks for more accurate sleep stage classification.
I have also published research on thyroid nodule classification using CT imaging and CNNs,
further emphasizing my drive to apply AI to practical, impactful challenges.
What excites me about SMILES 2025 is its intensive, hands-on structure, bringing together
exceptional minds to collaborate on generative models, multimodal learning, large language
models, and multi-agent systems – all areas highly relevant to my ongoing research. The
opportunity to attend expert-led lectures, participate in hackathoons, and engage in real-world
problem-solving will greatly enhance my ability to contribute to both academia and industry.
Being alrready based in [location] and fluent in navigating its academic environment, I am well-
prepared to attend the program in person. I am also enthusiastic about connecting with fellow
researchers from [location], [location], and around the world, contributing to and benefiiting from the
international collaboration and knowlage sharing that SMILES 2025 promotes.
I am confident that my technical background, research experience, and commitment to
innovation make me a strong candidate for this program. I am eager to contribute actively, learn
deeply, and bring my interdisciplinary perspective to the SMILES 2025 community.
Thank you for considering my application.
Warm regards,
