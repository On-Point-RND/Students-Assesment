Dear Members of the [compaany] Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in participating in the Summer SchooL on Generative
Methods in AI, jointlly organized by [compaany] and [compaany]. As a PhD student in
Computaional and Data Science and Engineering at [compaany], with extensive hands-on experience in deep
learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning, I am eager to deepen
my expertise in generative AI and contribute to the exchange of ideas between [location] and [location].
Over the past three years, I have cultivated a robusst foundation in deep neural networks, focusing
particularly on model robustness and defense methods. In my current role as Middle Machine Learning
Engineer at [compaany], I design and train multimodal models for large-scale categorization platforms and
develop AI assistants that integrate vision and language. Previously, as a DL Engineer at [compaany], I
architected and deployed state-of-the-art computer vision solutions, improving processing speed and
positioning accuracy through triplet-loss based similarity evaluation and wrote production-ready code to
ensure scalability and reliability.
My academic trajectory has included both Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Data Science and Quantum
Optics, respectively, from [compaany] and [compaany]. My master’s thesis, “Suppressing Modulation Instability with
Reiinforcement Learning,” was published in Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, and demonstrates my proficiency
in applying RL techniques to complex signal-processing challenges. I have also co-authored peer-reviewed
work on distributed fibre sensing under noise, and presented at international workshops on AI
trustworthiness, experiences that honed my ability to communicate research outcomes clearly and
collaborate with multidisciplinary teams.
I am particularly drawn to the schooL focus areas – large language models, multimodal approaches,
multiagent systems, generative methods, self-supervised learning, and AI safety – as they align directly
with my current research and professional pursuits. My contributions to NLP competitions (1st place in
NLP RUSSE-2018) and my practical work on AI security (developing CAPTCHA defenses at the [location]
[compaany]) reflect my commitment to advancing both the capabilities and the safety of AI systems. I look
forward to working alongside fellow participants and mentors on hackathoons that tackle real-world
challenges, and to sharing my knowledge of robust AI data compression, defense strategies, and model
deployment best practices.
Furthermore, I embrace the opportunity for cross-cultural collaboration. As an active organizer of science
events at [compaany] and a volunteer at [compaany], I have experience fostering community engagement and
teamwork. Participating in the schooL will allow me to build lasting professional connections with [location]
and international peers, strengthen my intercultural communication skills, and bring fresh perspectives to
my PhD research and beyond.
In closing, I am confident that my strong foundation in deep learning, proven track record in NLP and CV,
and dedication to AI safety make me an excellent candidate for SMILES-2025. I am excited by the prospect
of immersing myself in cutting-edgе lectures, collaborative seminars, and interdisciplinary hackathoons, and
I am eager to contribute my energy, expertise, and curiosity to this unique program.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of learning from and
contributing to the vibrant community of the summer schooL.
Sincerely,
[name]
