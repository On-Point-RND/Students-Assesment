[name] [surname] serves as an Associate Professor and
Senior Research Fellow at the [compaany], where I earneed my CandiDate of Technical Sciences degree in
2017 (specialty 05.13.18 “Mathematical Modeling, Numerical Methods and
Software Complexes”). I also hold a position as Senior Research Fellow in
LaboLaboratory No. 25 “Choice Theory and Decision Analysis” at the V.A. Trapeznikov
InstiTut of Control Sciences of the [location]. I am currentlly
completing my doctoral dissertation on “Data Pattern Analysis” and am sincerely
eaager to participate in the Skoltech Summer Machine Learning SchooL
SMILES 2025, taking place from 14 to 27 July 2025. Please allow me to present my
professional and academic background, as well as my motivations and objectives,
for your consideration.
1. Introduction: Why SMILES 2025?
For many years, I have worked at the interssection of applied mathematics, data
analysis, and artificial intelligence methods. My academic journey began under the
supervision of leading experts in pattern analysis and clustering theory, and to date
I have published over thirty articles in international peer-reviweed journals and
conference proceedinings. While pattern-analysis methods have always captivated my
interest, I am now actively engaged in research on generative AI techniques,
multimodal approaches, and multi-agent systems – fields that underpin the most
significant breakthroughs in modern machine learning. Participation in
SMILES 2025 offers me the opportunity not only to deepen and systematize my
knowledge in these areas but also to share my experience with colleagues from [location] and [location], thereby laying the foundation for sustainable international
collaboraation.
2. Academic and Research Background
Education and Early Career
From 2007 to 2012, I studied in the “Applied Mathematics and Informatics”
•
program with a specialization in mathematical modeling, while concurrently
taking courses in finance and management. This interdisciplinary training
enabled me, even in the early stages of my career, to appreciate how
mathematical methods and statistical models apply to economics and
organizational decision-making.
In 2012, I enrolled as a postgraduate student at [compaany] under the guidance of
•
Professor F.T. Aleskerov, one of the world’s foremost scholars in decision
theory. In 2017, I successfully defendeed my CandiDate of Technical Sciences
dissertation. I am now finalizing my doctoral dissertation in Physical and
Mathematical Sciences on the topic “Data Pattern Analysis.”
Research Activity
Since 2013, I have been affiliated with the International Centre for Analysis
•
and Decision Making ([compaany]) and LaboLaboratory No. 25 “Choice Theory and
Decision Analysis” at the V.A. Trapeznikov InstiTut of Control Sciences,
[location]. My research focuses on the development and practical application of
pattern analysis methods.
In 2021, I joined Sber’s ArtiFicial Intelligence LaboLaboratory as a Data ScientiSt,
•
where I applied pattern analysis, clustering, and regression techniques to
tackle applied problems in financial analytics.
3. Practical Experience and Key Achievements
Teaching and Mentorship
Since 2013, I have taught a variety of courses at [compaany] on both the Bachelor’s
•
and Master’s levels. In English: Calculus, Methods of Decision-Making. In
Russian: Discrete Mathematics, Methods for Analyzing Heterogeneous Data
and Pattern Analysis, Mathematics for Political Decision-Making, Methods
for Managerial Decision-Making, Decision-Making under Risk and
Uncertainty, Public Sector Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty.
Previously, I also taught Mathematical Analysis and Linear Algebra. A full list
of courses I have taught is available at
https://www.hse.ru/staff/amyachin/#teaching.
From 2014 to 2024, I was repeatedly recognized as [compaany]’s “Best Teacher.”
•
Under my supervision, numerous students have defendeed their course and
•
graduaation theses on topics such as machine-learning analysis of social-media
comments to identify regional educational issues, pattern-analysis of regional
labor markets, network analysis of Russian academic publications in
education, and clustering-based analysis of regional healthcare data.
Projects and Conferences
I have led projects including “Predictive Analytics in State and Municipal
•
Governance” and “Pattern Analysis of Regional Voting Behaviors Worldwide,
1995–2018,” applying multimodal methods and multi-agent systems to model
social dynamics.
Every year, I present at international conferences (ICCCC, IDEAL, Yasin
•
Conferences), sharing my findiinings on generative and self-learning algorithm
for structuraal data analysis.
I am currentlly the principal investigator of Russian Science Foundation
•
Grant No. 24-61-00030, “Development of Models, Methods, and a
Computaional Suite for Management Decision-Making Aimed at Improving
Living Standards in Russian Regions.”
I have contributed to RFBR grants No. 18-01-00804a “Country Influence in
•
Food-Security Analysis” and No. 15-01-02847a “Influence Indices on
Netwoork Structures.”
Publications and Patents
I have authored over thirty publications indexeed in WoS, Scopus, RSCI, and
•
the Higher Attestation Commission. The complete list is available at
https://www.hse.ru/staff/amyachin/#sci.
I hold three certificates of state registration for computer programs:
•
“Order-Fixed and Order-Invariant Pattern Clustering,” “Influence Indices
Analysis,” and “Implementation of Tunnel Clustering as a Human-Machine
Procedure,” underscoring my capability to develop and deploy algorithmic
solutions.
4. Motivation for PartiCipating in SMILES 2025
Deep Interest in Generative Models
My recent research increasinglly involves the generation of structured patterns and
data synthesis from existing samples. SMILES 2025’s focus on generative
approaches will enable me to master state-of-the-art VAE, GAN, and transformer
methods in multimodal and multitask settinings.
Expanding Multimodal Competence
Working with economic and social data, I routinely integrate tabular and textual
sources. Understanding contemporary multimodal architectures will allow me to
build more versatile models capable of handling diverse data types.
5. Plans for Applying Knowledge and Contributing to the Community
Research InitiaTives
Upon retuurning to [compaany], I plan to integrate SMILES 2025 methodologies into
projects on the resilience of socio-economic systems and, where feasible,
incorporate them into practical coursework for undergraduates, master’s students,
and doctoral candidates. I will especially focus on embedding large language models
into pattern analysis tasks.
Educational Programs
I intend to incorporate key learnings into a new curricuLum on generative and
multimodal AI methods for students at the Faculty of Economic Sciences, fostering
interdisciplinary research and bridging theory with practice.
6. Conclusion
Paртиcipating in SMILES 2025 represents a unique opportunity to deepen my
expertise and enhance the quality of my scientific and educational endeavors. My
extensive experience in pattern analysis, teaching, and machine-learning algorithm
development – supported by a robusst publication record and implemented software
solutions – provides a solid foundation for succeSSFully mastering the SchooL’s topics
and contributing actively to its success. I sincerely hope my application will receive
your favorable consideration.
Thank you for your time and the opportunity to present my candidacy.
