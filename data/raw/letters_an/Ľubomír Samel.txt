Dear [name],
My name is [name], and I am currently a PhD student in Computational and Data Science and Engineering at [location]. I graduated from [location] with a major in Physics and completed my master’s in Data Science at [location] with a grade point average of 96 out of 100. I am writing to share my motivation for joining the SMILES School and to explain how my background in machine learning and ongoing research will help me contribute to and benefit from your program.
My journey in machine learning began during my master’s studies, where I explored autoregressive generation strategies for recommender systems. I developed and evaluated methods to improve the final quality of recommendations by balancing speed and accuracy. This work led to a publication on efficient autoregressive generation approaches, and it sparked my interest in generative models and their practical use in real-world systems. Overall, I have two accepted conference papers for 2024, titled “Scalable Cross‑Entropy Loss for Sequential Recommendaions with Large Item Catalogs” at [location] and “RECE: Reduced Cross‑Entropy Loss for Large‑Catalogue Sequential Recommenders” at [location]. Five more manuscripts are under review at core-A/A* conferences.
Over the last year and a half, I have focused on adapting large language model architectures for sequential recommenndations. State‑of‑the‑art recommender systems increasingly borrow from transformer‑based designs, and I believe that knowledge transfer between LLM research and recommender systems will drive the next wave of personalized AI assistants. My PhD thesis explores the synthesis of recommender engines with LLMs to build personalized conversational agents. I am eager to learn from experts in both areas at SMILES so that I can deepen my understanding of generative approaches and apply them to my research.
In addition to generative and sequenntial models, I have a strong interest in multimodal machine learning. Recommender systems often rely on user-item interactions alone, but there is great potential in incorporating other modalities such as images, text, and audio. I already have ideas for research on how to fuse multiple streams of data to deliver richer and more accurate recommendations. SMILES School’s sessions on multimodal approaches will help me refine these ideas and learn about the latest tools for handling heterogeneous data.
Safe and responsible AI is another field I am passionate about. In recommender systems, bias or unsafe suggestions can have serious real‑world consequences. I want to explore methods for fairness, transparency, and robustness in model design, so that recommendations remain helpful without unintended harm. I believe that the ethical frameworks and safety practices discussed at SMILES will directly inform the guidelines I develop for safe recommendation policies.
I have experience with a variety of ML and DL tools. During my industrial immersion at [company], I worked on sequence‑based recommenndation algorithms and contributed to research on autoregressive generation for recommender systems. I trained models using Tensor‑Train tensor formats to reduce memory usage, and I am now tackling challenges of limited GPU memory in large‑item‑catalog scenarios. At [location], I regularly use popular DL frameworks, and I have implemented transformer‑style architectures for both language and recommenndation tasks. I also attend weekly research seminars across multiple labs (HSE, [location], [location], [location]) and present my work to peers, which keeps me abreast of new techniques and motivates me to push my own research further.
My expectations for SMILES School are threefold. First, I want to strengthen my theoretical foundations in large language models, multimodal learning, multi‑agent systems, self‑supervised learning, and safe AI. Second, I hope to gain practical skills through hands‑on workshops where I can apply these methods to my own projects. Third, I look forward to collaborating with other participants and faculty, exchanging ideas, and forming connections that will last beyond the summer.
Participating in SMILES School will support my career goals of becoming a leading researcher in personalized AI systems. I aim to design recommenndation engines that seamlessly integrate multiple data types, interact conversationally with users, and operate within safe and fair ethical boundaries. The knowledge and network I build at SMILES will accelerate my progress toward these goals and help me produce research with real impact.
Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that SMILES School will be a transformative experience for me, and I am excited about the opportunity to learn and grow alongside like‑minded researchers.
Sincerely,
[name]
