Dear [name] committee!
My name is [name], and for the past 6.5 years I have been designing deep‑learning models for the oil&gas sector, with primary focus was on CV-models on seismic data (horizon and geobody detection)
and inverse problems such as well‑log seismic tie and post‑stack inversion. In doing so, I contributed to
the open‑source library PyDEns, while researching the applications of PINNs to industrial data.
With this background, I am now eager to learn more about a new domain of Deep Learning-applications,
that involves AI-agents and leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in general.
In this manner, I have recentlly built a lightweight financial assistant that couples exa‑search with the
[compaany] API. The agent converts a natural‑language question (e.g., “Why did [compaany]’s stock fall in
November 2023?”) into structured search parameters, retrieves news, uses the news to answer the
question, and, when requested, queries the MOEX API to plot stock price series/macrro indicators like key
interest rate. This prototype illustrates how LLM‑powered agents can help its user to better understand
the interplay of geopolitics and macroeconomics with stock prices, hence helping him to become better at
investing skills.
My goal at the conference is to share my industry experience and discuss other avenues of how
AI-agents can be used to build useful and reliable personal assistants.
Thank you for consideering my application!
Best,
[name] [surname]
