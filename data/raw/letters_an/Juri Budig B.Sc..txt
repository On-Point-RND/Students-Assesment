Dear members of the [compaany] Admissions Committee,
My name is [name] [surname]. I am an undergraduate student in [compaany] and [compaany] at [location]. I am ranked first in my cohort. My long-term goal is to advance the field of safe and controllable artificial intelligence. Admission to your program is a logical next step.
My AI journey began a year ago when I joined [compaany]'s ”Intelligent systems” laboratory. My first project focused on spoofing detection in voice biometrics. Despite my initially limited experience with deep neural networks, my team and I engineered several models that achieved strong performance in deepfake detection, giving me practical insight into AI safety challenges amid rapidly evolving attack vectors.
A natural offshoot of the work was my interesting generative models. To understand their architectural foundations, we started developing a speech synthesis model and entered the ASVspoof 2024 international challenge. Targeting generalization to novel attack types, we replaced standard fully connected layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, ranking among the top 10 teams. These results underscored the limitations of state-of-the-art architectures in addressing AI safety concerns.
To deepen my expertise, I completed the ”Summer with AIRI” research programme, studying under leading scientists in multimodal and generative modeling, including such as [name], [name], [name]. Inspired by [name]'s lectures at the ”Data Fusion” conference on diffusion bridges, I am now exploring diffusion probabilistic models and how these approaches can be adapted to improve speech synthesis quality.
Our collaborative research has yielded multiple publications. I was first author on voice antispoofing paper in the Q2 journal Engineering, Technology & Applied Science Research and on another work presented at a workshop of the Interspeech conference. We have submitted a high-quality speech dataset paper to the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence and we are finalizing major studies on voice antispoofing and text-to-speech for submission to A* conferences. Supervising student projects on speaker identification robustness and mechanistic interpretability has further strengthened my leadership skills.
Together with [name]'s laboratory and ”Reliable and Secure Intelligent Systems” group, my team and I continue to investigate the safe deployment of generative models, including watermarking methods. These collaborations have enriched my understanding of rigorous AI research methodology.
Your programme offers a unique platform to merge my practical experience with cutting-edge approaches in generative and safe AI. Working with faculty whose interests align closely with mine will enable me not only to deepen my competencies, but also to contribute to a community shaping the future of the field.
Within five years, I plan to obtain master’s degree followed by a PhD. Over the longer term, I aim to lead a research group focused on the development of safe and controllable AI.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
