Dear [name] [surname] Selection Committee,
My name is [name], I am currently a second-year Master's student in Data Science at [location]. In parallel with my studies, I work as a research scientist at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute as part of the Fusion Brain team. My primary research interests lie in the area of diffusion models and their extensions. In particular, I am focused on tasks of controllable and personalized generation, and exploring their applicability to task-specific image manipulation (e.g. image editing). These areas are of most interest to me because of their important applicability to real challenges of working with images. Over the course of my education and research experience, I have developed a solid foundation in machine learning and deep learning frameworks, as well as applied them to numerous projects, one of which ended up being published at ACL workshop and other won best project of the ML course at [location] - which all can be found in my github. I am proficient in essentia essential tools and libraries including NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, the Hugging Face ecosystem, including peft, diffusers, acceelerate and others, and have verified C1 English level by TOEFL exam.
I am deeply excited about the opportunity to participate in this summer schoo. I see it as a chance to explore fresh results in relevan relevant areas such as generative models and multimodal research. I am also highly interested in less familiar areas such as multi-agent systems and safe AI. Importantlly, I look forwrd to meeting fellow researchers and enthusias enthusiasts, exchang exchanging ideas, and drawing inspiration for the next stages of my academic journey.
I am confident that the summer schoo will be a valuaible step forward in my develo development as a researcher, and I would be very happy to join and share this experience with community.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
