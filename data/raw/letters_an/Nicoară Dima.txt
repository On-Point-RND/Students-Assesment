My research interests encompass natural language processing, the interpretability of modern ML models, and multimodality. Specifically, my Master's thesis focuses on measuring the impact of knowledge graphs (KGs) in question answering. Through meticulous analysis, I have found that modern architectures struggle to effectively integrate structured knowledge from KGs into language models. I would be delighted to present my work at the SMILES poster session.
This research has been part of a broader journey in machine learning, which I pursued during my studies at [location] and through work at world-renowned AI companies such as [compaany] and [compaany]. My experience ranges from applying diffusion models for speech synthesis to distilling large language models (LLMs). However, I have always been passionate about gaining a deep understanding of the fundamental principles underlying ML algorithms. The works of [compaany], such as “Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning,” have been a significant source of inspiration for me. This passion has led me to join the MERA project—an LLM benchmark initiative dedicated to the comprehensive evaluation of LLM capabilities, uncovering their weaknesses, and gaining architectural insights.
My motivation for participating in SMILES is the unique opportunity to exchange knowledge with the international AI community and establish prospective collaborations. I am particularly eager to discuss current approaches to interpretability and ML model evaluation while exploring future research directions. At this stage of my academic path, I am actively seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD, with institutions like [location] and several leading Chinese universities among my top considerations. Therefore, the chance to connect with faculty and researchers from these institutions is especially valuable to me. In the long term, I aspire to become a leading global researcher in the field of natural language processing. I view attending SMILES as an important step toward this goal—broadening my perspective, refining my research agenda, and building meaningful academic relationships.
