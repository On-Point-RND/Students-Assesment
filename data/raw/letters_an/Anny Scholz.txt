I have been engaged in project and research activities for a long time. My first project was a smart trash bin that opened when a person approached it.
Later, I worked on developing a capacitive soil moisture sensor that functions like a capacitor, with its capacitance changing depending on the surrounding environment. In this project, I conducted numerous experiments with plants and various soil types to calibrate the sensor and understand the scope of its application.
After that, I developed a smart pedestrian crossing. In our [location], there are many unregulated pedestrian crossings that are poorly lit, which leads to fatalities and injuries at night. However, installing traffic lights and lighting in such places is economically impractical because people do not cross the road there frequently. I created a working prototype to solve this issue and implemented a software solution based on a neural network ([email]). When a person appears on the road, the neural network detects them, lights up the pedestrian crossing, and alerts drivers of the presence of a pedestrian.
Currently, I am working on two projects. Together with a friend, we are developing a school security system aimed at preventing terrorist attacks and incidents, which have unfortunately become more frequent lately. In this project, we use several neural networks to process video footage and detect potentially dangerous individuals.
My main project is training corvids to collect litter ([email]). Corvids are a bird family that includes magpies, crows, jackdaws, and many other species. People often consider them pests and try to exterminate them, but due to their intelligence, corvids quickly adapt, and such efforts prove futile. Instead of trying to eradicate these birds, we can cooperate with them. For example, corvids can help us collect litter in exchange for food. I’ve been working on this project for over five years and have developed several devices to train corvids to collect various items. Initially, it was coins, and now the birds are learning to bring cigarette butts in exchange for peanuts. The latest prototype includes two neural networks: one for identifying corvid species and another for sorting the items brought by the birds. I am currently developing a new prototype that will eventually be installed in city parks.
This project was presented at the Baltic Science and Engineering Competition, where I won the grand prize; at the ROST-ISEF competition, where I took second place and received a diploma from the American Psychological Association for achievements in biology; at the “Junior” competition organized by MEPhI, where I won third place; at the “Higher Pilotage” competition by HSE University, where I took first place; and at the “Big Challenges” competition, where I was a prize winner. In the summer of 2024, I won the Faculty of Computer Science research competition for prospective students at HSE University ([email]), with the main prize being full tuition coverage. I am now studying in the Applied Mathematics and Informatics program ([email], an English version is available within the page).
In the near future, I want to focus on four key directions within this project that will help it reach a new level. You can learn more in the video – [email].
I believe AI is a highly promising field, and I am eager to continue my professional development and implement projects in this area. I am particularly interested in the practical aspect—taking theoretical knowledge and results and turning them into large-scale applied projects.
I have always been interested in discovering and learning something new. Research allows us to find new paths and become pioneers in the field. Once we discover something new, that knowledge can be used to create impactful projects.
During my studies, I want to gain essential knowledge in computer science and mathematics, which I plan to apply in my future research and projects. I also hope to meet professors and instructors to quickly learn about their research and get involved. Knowledge must be applied in practice as soon as possible. I also want to exchange ideas about my own projects.
I have many plans for the future. For now, I aim to acquire knowledge during my university studies while simultaneously applying it to realize my ideas. Later, I would like to join a large IT company to gain experience in conducting serious research and developing projects for a broad audience. Ultimately, I dream of starting my own company focused on important and complex research, applying the findings to create innovative projects and products that improve people’s lives.
