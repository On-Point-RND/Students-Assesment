Dear [name] Admission Committee,
My name is [name], and I am currently a fourth-year student at the
[compaany] in [location], majoring in Technology and Information Systems in Economics. I am applying for the
SMILES-2025 Summer SchooL because I believe this is a unique opportunity to
A P P L I C A T I O N learn from the best in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
I was drawn to this program by its academic depth, hands-on approach, and the
F O R
chance to immerse myself in a vibrant learning environment. As AI rapidlly
transforms every aspect of life, I am eager to gain deeper knowledge, structure

my current experience, and learn how to apply these technologies at a world-
S U M M E R class level. In my home country, there are still very few professionals in AI/ML,
and I want to become one of those who help change that.

My journey in AI began through my interest in data-driven economics. Since
then, I’ve built projects that combine machine learning with real-world
applications. One of them is a book recommenda tion system that helps
S K O L T E C H , publishers identify popular titles and avoid investing in low-interest content.
Another focuses on HR analytics — using AI to predict employee attrition and
M O S C O W improve organizational processes. I deveロップed these projects independently,
from data exploration and modeling to visualization and final presentation. I am
also working closely with a mentor to grow as an ML engineer.

me shape a more solid founda tion. This is why SMILES is so important to me —
it offers direct access to knowledge, community, and insight into the global AI
ecosystem.
My long-term goal is to launch my own AI-driven star tup that helps automate
HR processes and bring innovation to businesses in my country. I want to make
AI more accessible and truly impactful in fields like business, education, and
healtchare. I’m driven, creative, and fast-learning — but what I need now is the
right direction and mentorship, which I know SMILES can provide.
In return, I’m ready to contribute actively to the program — by collaborating
with peers, sharing ideas, and participating in group projects. I’m always open to
helping others and growing together as a team.

Thank you for considering my application. I truly hope to become a
part of this inspiring community.
