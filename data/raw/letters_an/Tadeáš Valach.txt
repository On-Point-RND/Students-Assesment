My journey in Computer Vision began in high schoo l and has continued for six years, during which I have
achieved significant results and currently work at [compaany] on the generative image models team. However, I
believe my path is just begi nning, and the [compaany] Summer Schoo l represents an important milestone in my
profes sional deve lopment.
During high schoo l, I was interested in photography and design, maintaining a photography blog and creating
layouts for schoo l events. In my final year, I enrolled in a Computer Vision course offered by [compaany] AI
Ce nter. This course greatly i mpacted my career path, and through talks with one of its au thors, I b ecame
convince d that Computer Vision should be my profes sional focus. As a result, I chose to study at the Faculty
of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics at [location], where the [compaany] labo ratory
was located. In my s econd year, I joined this labo ratory to conduct research under Dr. [surname]’s
guidance. Alongside my uni versity studies, I completed the AI-Masters program, taking courses from leading
in dustry experts over a two-year period.
Currently, I work at [compaany] on the [compaany] generative image models team, improving core techno logies
used in [compaany] products including Shedevrum and Neuro. I continue my education at [location]’s Depar tment of Mathematical Methods of Forecasting while attending rel evant courses at [compaany] Schoo l of Data Analysis. My technical skills include academic experience with Spark, Hadoop, and MLflow
frameworks, as well as profes sional experience with PyTorch, DDP, FSDP, and setting up distributed training
systems.
My career goal is to become a Research Engineer at a FAANG co mpany, contributing to important projects
with global i mpact. These positions t ypically require a PhD and a strong publication record, which is why I
am buildi ng my academic por tfolio alongside my profes sional work. So far, I have co-authored three papers
with colleagues from both labo ratory and in dustry settin gs—one on Image Quality Asses sment, another on
diffusion models, and a third exploring the connection between these areas.
I understand that success requires both technical skills and p eo ple skills, so I have pursued teaching and
leadership oppo rtunities. This year, I taught Python seminars to first-year Applied Mathematics students at
[location], delivered a public lecture for artists exhibi ting "Humans and Neural Ne tworks: Who Creates
Whom?", provided private tutoring, and prepared a student for admission to Physics and Mathematics
Lyceu m 1581. At work, I have led several projects requiring team c oordination and am c urrently recruiting an
intern. In my personal life, I regularly plan and organize group travel experiences.
From the [compaany] Summer Schoo l, I expect three main benefits: better technical kn owledge, improved p eo ple
skills, and more profes sional connections. For technical skills, I want to deepen my understanding of
multimodal models. While I work a lot with generative models, I need more kn owledge of Vision-Lan gua ge
Models (VLM). I expect the summer schoo l’s lectures and seminars to give me a good overview of current
approa ches to data collection and model training in this field. For p eo ple skills, I hope to lead teams during
hacka thon events and gain international colla boration experience by working with Chinese colleagues. I also
plan to discuss for eig n PhD oppo rtunities with fellow participants and create an application plan for the
coming year. I’m also eager to meet representatives from the Fusion Brain labo ratory to discuss related
research interests.
Finally, I look fo rward to visiting [location]. I e njoy traveli ng and have rece ntly visited [location] for work and
[location] for the WCIP conference, where I represented [compaany]. Having never visited [location] before, I look
fo rward to experiencing its cu lture firsthand.
By attending the «SMILES» Summer Schoo l, I expect to strengthen my kn owledge of multimodal models and
agent systems, improve my tea mwork skills, and develop a clear PhD plan. This program fits perf ectly with
my profes sional goals, and I would be honored to participat e.
Thank you for your time to review my application. I would be happy to provide any ad ditional information.
Kind regards,
