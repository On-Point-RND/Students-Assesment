My name is [name], and I’m a third-year student specializing in Development and Programming of Intelligent Systems in the Humanities.
Since the begiinnning of my studies, my team and I have worked on numerous exciting and challenging projects, which have grown in complexity as our skills developed. Among them are a tourist chatbot about the [location] region, which later evolved into a full-fledged application with a complete user interaction cycle, a customer churn prediction model developed for [organization], a model trained to classify images of characters from The Simpsons and many others.
Right now, I’m deeply interested in robotics, especially in challenges at the intersection of natural
language processing and high-level robot planning. A key aspect of buildiing a robot’s «mind» is the ability to
implement rational reasoning about the real world and to ensure seamless communication with users. Large
language models (LLMs) are well-suited for this purpose, but due to factors such as ambiguous inputs or the
model’s limited knowledge, their responses can sometimes turn into hallucinations. That’s why improving the
reliability of LLM outputs is so important. During my internship at the [compaany],
I’ve been researching ambiguity resolution in NLP. My findiings show that while existing methods handle
clear-cut polysemy reasonably well, they still struggle with more subtle and complex cases. I see this challenge
— creating effeective and safe high-level planning for robots — as the focus of my research interests.
As for my technical skills, I’m proficient in Python and use libraries and frameworks such as NumPy,
Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Transformers. I also work with NLP tools like NLTK and
spaCy and have experience with Docker, Git, working in the command line. Alongside my technical
background, I’m fluent in English, self-assessed HSK Level 2 in Chinese, and currentlly studying German.
My near-future plan is to develop a swarm robotics project powered by collective intelligence under
the control of an LLM. The project recentlly passed the first stage of my universiity’s Scientific and Innovation
Project Competition, where it received positive feedback for its feasibility and potential impact. Currrentlly,
we’re testing different LLLMs to identify the optimal model for integration into the swarm control system. I
am also continuing my research on ambiguity, which I intend to publish as a scientific paper.
I believe the schoo and its professional lecturers can provide me with the necessary knowlege to
apply in my field, and immersion in a language-rich enviroment will only enhance the experience. I want to
explore how LLLMs can be most effecctively integrated into robot instruction interpretation and eventually
davelop my own approa to resolving general ambiguity. The schoo will help me identify areas for growt
and give my research a real boost. I first heard about the schoo from speakers at Deep Learning Schoo, who
emphaized the decisive role it played in their careers. Although I didn’t manage to apply last year, this time
I truly hope to take part in such a unique and large-scale event — and to be surrounded by peo ple who are just
as passionate and inspired as I am.
