Motivation letter
My name is [name] [surname], I am applying to SMILES-2025 to
acquire the best of modern practice in generative AI, find new collaborations,
and build interdisciplinary connections. I believe it would benefit my ongoing
research and help me on my path to contribute to world science.
I have participated in SMILES previously, and I am really happy with that
experience. I presented my research projects on blending theory of ODEs with
neural networks for tabular tasks and uncertainty-aware sea ice forecasting via
video prediction models, and I excelled in research challenges. Participation at
the school led me to an internship at [company]. I am grateful to SMILES and
[company] for the opportunities. Since then, I have finished two research papers
that are currently under review and continue researching. Now I am working
with efficient uncertainty estimation methods for numerical weather prediction
models, both traditional ensembles and machine learning approaches like
surrogate modelling and generative AI. My final goal is to push the boundaries
of computational feasibility and increase computational- and data-efficiency in
areas like geoscience, physics, biology.
I strongly believe the skills and practices I can acquire at the
SMILES-2025 would help me with my endeavors and on my future path. I am
ready to enhance my knowledge, gain experience, and exchange it with peers.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
