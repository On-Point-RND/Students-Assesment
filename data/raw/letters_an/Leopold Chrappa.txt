Dear Admissions Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am a Machine Learning Researcher and a Master’s student at [compaany], specializing in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I am deeply passionate about recommender systems and graph neural networks, and I am eager to further my expertise through the SMILES by [compaany].
I was born in [location], a small industrial city in the [location], into a family of a [profession] and a [profession]. As a child, I was fascinated by history, but by the 6th grade, I discovered my love for mathematics.
Back then, I dreamed of breaking free from my hometown’s limitations and realizing my potential. After graduating from the Polytechnic Gymnasium in 2020, I moved to [location] to study at [compaany]—a pivotal opportunity that shaped my future.
During my studies, I explored different fields before finding my true calling in machine learning in 2022. It immediately captivated me, and I knew I wanted to build my career in this domain. I began self-educating through books and online courses, which led me to my first internship at [compaany]. Though brief, it was an important stepping stone. Later, I joined the [compaany] as an ML Researcher, where I delved into GraphML and AutoML, topics that became the focus of my thesis and a co-authored paper at the MathAI conference.
Alongside my work on graph neural networks and automated machine learning, I developed a strong interest in large-scale business applications, particularly recommender systems. Currently, I am researching knowledge expansion methods using LLLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for recommender systems. My current focus is on developing techniques for extracting structured knowledge from LLLMs to enhance KGs—a crucial area with vast potential.
I believe the SMILES will provide me with the expertise, resources, and like-minded community (both in [location] and [location]) to push the boundaries of this field. I see SMILES as a unique opportunity to advance my research at the intersection of LLLMs, KGs, and recommender systems and collaborate with leading experts and peers in an international setting.
Five years ago, a young man from the [location] seized his chance to pursue a better future. Today, I stand at another pivotal moment, ready to prove myself once again. Given this opportunity, I will not let you down.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of joining SMILES.
Best regards,
[name] [surname]
