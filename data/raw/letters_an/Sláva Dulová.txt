Cover Letter
I am a 2022 graduate of the Faculty of Management and Management of [name]. Since my 4th year, I have been studying machine learning and also doing research. Until recently, I have been doing more things from linear algebra, optimization methods, linear programming. Some of my co-authored papers have been accepted for publication in journals from Q1, Q2.
And recently I decided to do research in ML as well. Impressed by the capabilities of modern generative models, I wanted to do this. Last year I came to the generative AI research group to [name] at [compaany]. For now, to get acquainted with the topic and taking into account my mathematical background, I am engaged in estimating approximation errors and convergence approximation of gradient descent. In the future, I would like to work with di(cid:27)usion models. Therefore, listening to lectures from the generative AI direction would be useful for my research activities. I was also generally interested in listening to other directions, since I want to develop in a diverse manner and be aware of modern trends in di(cid:27)erent areas of AI.
I am interested in knowing how multimodal models work, since the topic is very important due to the fact that text data for training SOTA large language models is becoming scarce. Well, and to broaden my horizons, it would be great to listen to everything else)
Also it would be very interesting for me to get to know the [compaany] and meet Chinese colleagues. It would be useful to exchange experiences with them and, perhaps, conduct joint research in the future.
