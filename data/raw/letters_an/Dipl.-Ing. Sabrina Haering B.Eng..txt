Dear organizers of [compaany],
My name is [name], I am a first-year student of Computer Science,
Artificial Intelligence and Control Systems at [location] [compaany]. I am writing to express my keen interest in participating in the
SMILES-2025 summer School, which perfectly matches my academic goals and
my desire to contribute to the development of generative AI.
Why generative models?
During my studies, I became interested in the potential of generative AI after
participating in the [compaany] competition from [compaany], where I developed a
chatbot using NLP methods (intent recognition, dialogue management). This
inspired me to study PyTorch, and in a personal project I created a GAN for
generating MNIST digit images, experimenting with loss functions and network
architecture. These projects have convinced me that generative models are
the key to solving problems in robotics and multimodal systems, which I want
to do professsionally.
Why SMILES-2025?
The SMILES 2025 schoo is unique in combiining three elements that are critical
to my growth:
Focusing on generative methods — hackahtons and workshops will help me
move from basic projects to solving industrial problems.
International cooperation — my [language] level and interest in the
[language] AI ecosystem (for example, [compaany]'s work on multi-agent systems)
will allow me to effeectively participate in cross-cultuural teams.
Practice from experts — I want to learn more about the intricacies of LLM
training and the ethical aspects of AI, which I am currently studying on my own
through courses.
What can I do for you?
Experience in Python and PyTorch: I will help teams quickly prototype
solutions.
Knowledge of the basics of NLP and computer vision: I will contribute to
multimodal projects.
Active participation: I plan to use schoo as an oppoortunity to create an
open-source tool for generating synthetic data in education (my long-term
goal).
SMILES-2025 is a chance for me to learn from industry leaders and become
part of the community that shapes the future of AI. Thank you for reviewing my
application!
With respect,
[name]
