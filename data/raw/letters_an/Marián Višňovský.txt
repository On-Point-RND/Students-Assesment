I am a first-year Master’s student in Modern Computer Science. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Information Science from [location], specializing in Machine Learning and Applications, which I completed with GPA 9.4/10 and a red diploma. During my studies, I took courses in Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Bayesian Methods in ML, DL in Audio, Natural Language Processing, and Multimodal LLMs, and I plan to further develop these skills during the school. Currently, I am an instructor for a Research Seminar, where I guide fourth-year Bachelor students in analyzing scientific papers, and I intend to incorporate materials from the school into the course.
My research interests focus on multimodal systems that require working with text, vision, and audio. My initial foray into multimodal research began with computer vision, where I was deeply inspired by architectures like CLIP and MERU (Hyperbolic CLIP). I also explored text-guided diffusion models, appreciating their ability to steer generation through classifier-free guidance. Recently, I shifted to audio processing and its integration with language models. My first steps in this field involved projects on speech recognition and speaker separation, which I later combined into a unified pipeline. Now I am particularly interested in audio encoders for LLMs, which aim to map audio signals into embeddings compatible with text representations. In my previous project (detailed in my presentation), I investigated self-supervised pretraining strategies for audio encoders. My current challenge is temporal grounding: equipping LLMs to reference precise timestamps when answering audio-based queries (e.g., “When was X mentioned?”). In the future, I would like to explore working with video by integrating audio and vision modalities in an LLM and leveraging ideas from both domains at once.
I seek to attend this school to advance my LLM expertise and explore cross-modal techniques. The school’s focus on language models and multimodality aligns perfectly with my research interests. Research seminars are my favorite part of university life, and as an instructor for bachelor students at [location], I am always looking for new ideas to enrich my teaching. Moving forward, the knowledge I gain here will be essential for working with audio/vision representations and building more versatile multimodal language models.
