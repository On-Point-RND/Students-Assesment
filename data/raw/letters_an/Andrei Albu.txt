Motivation Letter
Dear Admissions Committee,
I am excited to apply for the SMILES Summer School of Machine Learning 2025. As someone deeply passionate about machine learning and its applications, I am eager to participate in this program to expand my knowledge and collaborate with like-minded people.
Currently, I am working on a project focused on camera accuracy studies, where I develop algorithms to process images to get precise positions of cameras relative to fields based on field markup. This project is giving me hands-on experience in using ML to solve real problems. Additionally, I found that RL is one of the best existing approach for my pet project on matrix multiplication optimization. Inspired by the [compaany] DeepMind team's work on fine-tuning AlphaGo for this task, I my current goal is to recreate their results and then try to apply their approach at a higher level of abstraction to achieve some insights. This project is particularly challenging due to the limited availability of (labeled) data, making RL essential.
My internship as an ML Engineer at [compaany] has further enhanced my practical skills. I engineered features for candidate generation and created pipelines that improved production metrics, giving me valuable experience in applying machine learning in industry settings.
Academically, I have a strong foundation. I graduated from the [location] with a GPA of 4/5 and am currently pursuing a Bachelor in Software Engineering at the [location] with a GPA of 8/10. My coursework and projects (which are listed in cv) have equipped me with a solid understanding of ML, DL and CV.
I am particularly interested in the SMILES program because it offers a unique opportunity to learn from leading experts and engage with other participants.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of participating in the SMILES Summer School of Machine Learning 2025 and contributing to its success.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
