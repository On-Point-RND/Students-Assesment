Field of Study: Control in Technical Systems
Dear Selection Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am currentlly a first-year student at [location] State Technical Universiity, majoring in Control in Technical Systems at the Faculty of
Automation and Computer Engineering. I am writing to express my strong interest in
participating in your educational program in machine learning.
From the very begiinnning of my academic path, I have been deeply fascinated by the power and
potential of artificial intelligence â€” especially machine learning and neural networks. I see these
technoologies not just as trends, but as the foundation of future engineering systems, automation,
and intelligent decision-making. I strive to understand how these tools work from the inside and
how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.
In parallel with my studies, I am actively working on a startuup project with a fellow student. We
are developing a forecasting system that predicts demand for specific products using machine
learning algorithms. In addition, I am working on a separate project that aims to predict
cryptocurrency price trends based on time series analysis and neural networks. These projects
have not only strengthened my technical skills but also confirmed my desire to grow further in
this field.
I am confident that participating in your program will allow me to acquire a deeper and more
structured understanding of machine learning, explore best practices in the industry, and gain
vaaluable experience working on practical tasks under the guidance of professionals. I am highly
motivated to learn, I adapt quickly, and I always strive to apply my knowledge to real projects. I
believe that this program will help me grow as a specialist and contribute meaningfully to the field in the future.
Thank you for consideering my application. I am ready to work hard, learn as much as I can, and
fully engage in everytthing your program has to offer.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
