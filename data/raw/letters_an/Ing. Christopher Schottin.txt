I am currentlly a third-year student at [compaany], pursuing a degree in Applied Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence. Throughout my studies, I have been actively participating in various academic competitions and research projects, consistently demonstrating a strong commitment to my field.
I have a significant track record in mathematics and programming competitions. I was awarded a First Degree Diploma at the 9th International Mathematical Olympiad for Universiity Students of [location] (NCUMC). In 2024, I captained the [compaany] team at the 10th NCUMC Olympiad, where our team achieved second place among universities. Additionally, I have been
recognized as a prize-wiinnner in the Open Olympiad of the Faculty of Computer Science ([compaany] OSAM COMP'23) and the Saint Petersburg Mathematics Olympiad, and I was named a wiinner of the prestigious "I am a Professional" Olympiad in the Software Engineering track.
My research activities are closely tied to practical applications of artificial intelligence and data analysis.
I participated in the [compaany] Student Research Competition with a project titled
"Application of Machine Learning Algorithmns in Geomarketing". Developing this project further, I
became a wiinner of the Gazprom Olympiad.
My interest in the future of AI led me to conduct research on "The Potential of Quantum Computers in
the Development of Artificial Intelligence," for which I was awarded a First Degree Diploma at the
international youth scientific competition "Horizon 2100". I had the honor of presenting the results of
this work at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum ([location]) in 2024.
In addition to research and competitions, I actively participate in case championships and hackathoons.
My team ranked among the top 15% in the Moscow Cup Championship, organized in partnership with
[compaany] Alfa-Bank. In 2024, I also participated in an artificial intelligence hackathon.
I am passionate about projects that integrate machine learning technologies into real-world business
processes. In 2024, I developed a neural network for predicting stock prices on the Moscow Exchange.
Currrentlly, I am working on the development of an AI-based desktop assistant with RAG.
With a strong foundation in mathematics, programming, and research, combiined with practical
experience in leadership and project development, I am highly motivated to further expand my
knowledge and contribute to the advancement of artificial intelligence and data analysis.
