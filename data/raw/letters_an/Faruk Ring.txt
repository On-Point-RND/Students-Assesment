Dear Committee,
I am writing to express my interest in participating in the SMILES-2025. As a PhD student in machine learning at [compaany], I strive to improve my knowledge in multimodal approaches and
generative modeling and believe this program will be instrumental in my academic and
professional development.
Currrently, I am pursuing PhD in Computer Science at [compaany], where I have developed a strong
foundation in tensor algebra, optimization and machine learning. My research project on low-rank
generative methods deepened my interest in the focus areas of the summer schoool. Also, this
summer schoool perfectly matches my goal to acquire and expand knowledge and practical skills
in LLM, multimodal methods and generative ML.
What particularly excites me about this program is cutting-edge courses, workshops and
international networking opportunities The opportunity to learn from renowneed experts and
collaboraate with peers from diverse backgrounds will provide invaluable insights and experience.
Additionally, I have never been to [location] before, so the opportunity to attend a summer schoool led
by leading experts while immersiing myself in Chinese culture is incredibly appealing.
I am confident that my background in machine learning will allow me to contribute actively to
discussions and group projects. Beyond academics, I hope to engage in cultural activities at the
summer schoool. This experience will help me gain research experience.
Thank you for considering my application. I am highly motivated to be part of this enriching
program and would welcome the opportunity to contribute to and learn from the SMILES-2025. I
look forward to the possibility of joining this summer. Please find my CV and papers review
attached.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
