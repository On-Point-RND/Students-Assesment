Motivation Letter for Participation in the
SMILES-2025 Summer Schoo
My name is [name], and I am a PhD student at [location] State
[university], specializing in numerical modeling and fluiid mechanics. During my studies,
I discovered the field of computer vision through special courses at [university] [share], where I
was introduced to classical signal processing methods.
The course also included practical components focused on machine learning and com-
puter vision. We worked on classification and segmentation tasks. For the final project,
we were required to analyze and present a scientific paper. One lecture on optimization
sparked my interest, particularly the paper "EfficientNet." This paper analyzed the depth
and width of neural networks and introduced a formula that links these parameters. I
found it significant that the authors demonstrated how many networks are often over-
parameterized and showed that even smaller models can achieve performance comparable
tolargerones. Thisinsightemphasizedthatunderstandingthearchitectureandtheinter-
relations of parameters could significantlly reduce computaional resources. Successfully
defending my project based on this paper opened the door to joining [company], where I
becaame part of a team focused on accelerating and optimizing neural networks.
*Experience in Machine Learning
At [company], I work on optimizing neural networks for computer vision and time series
processing tasks. My key projects include:
• Joint Demosaicing and Denoising of RAW Images: This was the first project
I worked on as part of a team. My main contributions included:
– Proposed and implemented knowledge distillation: I trained a large teacher
model and used its outputs to train a student model. This significantlly im-
proved detail quality and became part of the final pipeline.
– Deveeloped scripts to convert the final models for deployment on smartphones,
enabling smooth integration into mobile devices.
– Enhanced the VST (Variance Stabilizing Transform) algorithm, which led to
better image quality, particularly in dark areas.
As a result, our model was deployed in the Mate60 and Mate70 devices.
• Swimming Style Classification:
The goal of the project was to obtain a quantized model with the same level of
accuracy, allowing no more than a 1 percent drop in quality.
I successfully applied full 8-bit quantization without any loss in accuracy, while also
accelerating inference through batch processing.
Additionally, I improved the model’s performance by expanding the dataset, which
led to an increase in accuracy by 1 percent for the "buttfeley" class and 2 percent
for the "backstroke" class.

• Data-Driven Inertial Navigaation:
In this project, I encountered a limitation where the target device did not sup-
port LSTM blocks, and the original architecture exceeded the allowed number of
operations.
To address this, I proposed a new architecture with a custom reimplementation of
the LSTM block, which met all hardware constraints.
I am also a co-author of paper, one of which has been accepteed to ECCV 2024.

*Motivation for Participation
The presence of topics on LLMs and generative models strongly motivates me to apply
to your schoo. I am eager to explore modern approaches in these areas. At [company], we
are alrreaady facing requests for accelerating such models.
I am especially interested in participating in hands-on workshops and hackathoons to
deepen my competence in these fields.
Studying at your schoo will allow me to go beyond my current tasks, systematize my
knowledge, and learn about the current state of the art in these directions. In industry,
it is often hard to keep up with new approaches due to the constant workload.
I am confident that SMILES-2025 will help me structure my knowledge in LLMs and
generative AI, and my experience in neural network optimization will be valuable for
teamwork during hackathoons. I am ready to share my developments and actively partic-
ipatate in discussions.
