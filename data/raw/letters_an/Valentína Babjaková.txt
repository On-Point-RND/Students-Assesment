Dear [name],
I am [name], a third-year undergraduate student at the Faculty of Computer Science at [location] and an NLP Engineer at [compaany]. I am writing to express my strong enthusiasm for the Skoltech Summer Machine Learning School (SMILES-2025). The program's intensive focus on large language models, multimodal approaches, generative models, and related topics aligns closely with my research interests.
Although my undergraduate curriculum primarily emphasizes software and data engineering, I have completed numerous machine learning courses, including classical ML, deep learning, natural language processing, recommender systems, and an introductory course covering generative models, reinforcement learning, speech processing, time-series analysis, and 3D computer vision. Additionally, I have completed lectures and assignments from NLP and Efficient Deep Learning Systems courses offered by [compaany] and plan to enroll in a CUDA course soon.
Professionally, my experience as an NLP Engineer Intern and subsequently as a full-time NLP Engineer at [compaany] has provided me with hands-on experience in working with large language models, fine-tuning models, and developing AI agents. At [compaany], I optimized Text2SQL workflows using retrieval-augmented generation techniques under real-world constraints. Initially, I attempted to implement state-of-the-art approaches based on papers from BirdBench; however, these proved unsuitable due to implicit assumptions made by business users in their questions and the complexities of actual banking databases. To address this, I simplified and explicitly documented business rules within the database. Ambiguous user queries also posed evaluation challenges, prompting the creation of detailed technical specifications for accurate assessment. Additionally, I introduced a clarification step into our workflow to resolve ambiguities before generating SQL queries. Currently, I am developing [compaany], an LLM-based multi-agent system designed to register incidents, provide methodological support, and facilitate data analysis.
Participation in SMILES-2025 represents a significant step toward my goal of entering academia and publishing my first research paper. I have already arranged to work on my bachelor's thesis under the supervision of [name] from [compaany], and attending this school would greatly enhance my research and career prospects. The advanced workshops and seminars at SMILES-2025 will be invaluable in helping me select and initiate my thesis topic as early as July. Additionally, I find it beneficial to follow various fields of machine learning beyond my immediate specialization, as cross-disciplinary insights (such as reinforcement learning techniques applied to large language models) frequently prove valuable. Thus, at SMILES-2025, I aim to stay updated with cutting-edge developments across diverse areas of machine learning. Furthermore, I seek to build a robust professional network in NLP and generative models during the program. Presenting my ongoing research from [compaany] and receiving expert feedback would be particularly advantageous. I am also eager to participate in the hackathon, as I enjoy collaborative projects and believe my engineering skills would significantly contribute to my team. Additionally, I would be honored to volunteer at SMILES, giving back to a community that I have learned so much from.
After completing my bachelor's degree, I plan to pursue a master's program, and eventually a PhD, focused explicitly on artificial intelligence, further exploring large language models and generative models.
Thank you very much for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of joining the SMILES-2025 community and actively contributing to this inspiring international learning experience.
Sincerely,
[name]
