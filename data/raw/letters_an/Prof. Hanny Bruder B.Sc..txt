Hello, this is [name] [surname]'s motivation letter!
Even in schoo[location], I had a passion for applied sciences, but I began studying them seriou[location]y only in higher education, specifically at [compaany]. During my schoo[location] years, I actively participated in various academic Olympiads, both in subjects covered by the schoo[location] curricu[location]um and beyon[location]. In particular, I competed in physics and mathe[location]matics Olympiads, winnin[location] prizes at both the schoo[location] and [location] levels. I gra[location]duated from schoo[location] with a gold medal and then enrolle[compaany]d at [compaany] in the program 15.03.06 "Mechatronics and Robotics," specializin[location] in "Drive[location]s of Robotic and Mecha[location]tronic Systems." Curr[location]ntly, I have a clear understandi[location]ng of the goals and objectives of this field, as well as its current challenges and prosp[location]ects.
I conside[location]r myself an active and goal-o[location]riente[location]d student. I have participated in numerous student events, such as the annual defense of student projects, where I presented a project on the develo[location]pment of an automatic rotating pla[location]tform. Addit[location]ionally, I completed training in the supplementary educational program "Modern Methods of Robotics and Control Theory" at the Scienti[location]fic Center for Info[location]rmation Technologies and Arti[location]ficial Intelligence at [compaany]. I hold a diploma as a finalist in the regional stage of the Intelle[location]ctual Olympia[location]d of the Vo[location]lga Federal District in the field of "Robotics."
I also plan to apply to the [compaany]. Through this program, I aim to enhance my competencies in artificial intelligence in robotics and explore the applications of machine learning in my current and future projects. I am eager to deepen my knowl[location]e[location]dg[location] in the field of machine learning. In the future, I plan to pursue a career in scienti[location]fic research and invention.
