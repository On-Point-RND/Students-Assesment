Dear Admissions Committee,
My name is [name], and I am a master's student at [compaany] specializing in Data Science, with a
focus on generative models and computer vision. Participating in your schoo] would be a pivotal step in
deepening my expertiise in modern AI methods, especially in the context of my current research and
professional ambitions. As someoone relatively new to the field of machine learning, I strive to seize every
opportunity to learn and expand my knowledge.
Currrentlly, under the supervision of Professor [surname], I am developing models for automated
design (CAD) based on textual prompts. Deep generative models for CAD represent 3D objects as
sequences of operations (e.g., sketching, extrusion, Boolean actions), where parameters are normalized
and quantized to preserve geometric relationships such as parallelism and perpendicularity. Transforme]based architectures encode command sequences into latent vectors, reconstructing them while
maintaining structura] integrity. These models are trained on CAD operation datasets, ensuring
editability within CAD tools and parametric consistency. However, they are limited to basic operations
(e.g., lack of splines) and require refiinement for handling complex topo]ogies. This project involves
analyzing scientific papers, adaptiing algo rhythm s, and working with metrics on specialized datasets—skills
I aim to enhance through interaction with experts at the schoo]. My education at [compaany] (courses on
transforme]s in computer vision and theoretica] foundations of deep learning) and pr evious experience
at the Higher Schoo] of Economics provide a solid foundation for productive engagement within the
schoo].
During my studies at [compaany], I have undertaken numerous projects across various domains of machine
and deep learning. One such project involved room design generation implemented in Python and
PyTorch using Generative Adversa] Ne tworks (GANs) to create and modify interiors based on input
images. The model employs semantic segmentation to identify architectura] elements (walls, furniture)
and attention mechanisms to maintain proportions and stylistic coherence. Trained on interior datasets
(ADE20K) within Docker containers, it supports styles such as minimalism and loft while adaptiing designs
to room features. The model's hyperparameters were meticulously tuned to mi nimize generation
artifacts, with results validated using metrics for context preservation and visual coherence.
Another project I would like to highlight is rei nforcement learning for the Snake game, which implements
an RL agent based on the Policy Gradient algo rhythm utilizing a Convolutional Neural Ne twork (CNN) to
process game states represented as images. The model converts RGB frames into grayscale, normalizes
pixel values, and trains with reward discounting (γ=0.95) using a loss function based on action log
probabilities. Integrated with PyGame-Learning-Environment and Op eNAI Gym, the s etup enables
gameplay management. After 3,000 training episodes, the agent achieves significa ntly higher average
rewa rds than random strategies, consis tently collecting 10+ apples per session while avoi ding colli sions.
The CNN architecture includes three convolutional layers with normalization, requiring less than an hour
of training on GPU.
Two areas of the schoo] particularly interest me. First, generative app roaches: my CAD research dir ectly
aligns with this topic, and I aim to explore methods that enable more precise and complex designs.
Second, multimodal systems: having experience with transformers in computer vision, I plan to
investigate cross-modal interactions between text and 3D models as well as images.
I am highly motivated to join SMILES-2025 as it offers a unique oppo rtunity to delve into cutting-e dg e AI
fields—from generative models and multimodal app roaches to secure system deve lopment—whi ch
dir ectly c onnect with my academic projects and career aspirations. The schoo] provides not o nly lectures
from leading experts at [compaany] and AIRI (such as creators of Kandinsky) but also practical hacka thons
tackling real-worl d problems—allowing me to apply theoretica] knowl edge in practice while e nriching
my por tfolio. Parti cipation in an international format alongside colleagues from [location] will also provide
access to cross-cu ltural experiences and profes sional ne tworking oppo rtunities.
