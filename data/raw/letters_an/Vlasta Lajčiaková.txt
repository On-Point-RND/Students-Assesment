Dear Admissions Committee,
I am thrilled to apply for SMILES-2025, an opportunity that feels like a game-changer for my journey in machine learning and deep learning. The school’s reputation, amplified by its scientific partnership with [compaany]—a company I’ve long admired for its cutting-edge contributions to AI—has me genuinely pumped to dive in. I’m eager to soak up knowledge, connect with brilliant minds, and push my skills to the next level in an international setting.
My motivation stems from a deep passion for AI and a hunger to be part of something ground-breaking. [compaany]’s participation (as well as other parties’) signals that this school will provide top-quality, innovative content, and I want to be in the room where this happens. The international vibe of the program is a massive draw: collaborating with diverse and talented people from around the world is the perfect way to improve my technical and interpersonal skills. I am excited for the opportunity to spark new ideas, forge connections, and maybe even start some dope collaborative projects that could turn into something extraordinary.
My experience in ML and DL is rooted in both academic and practical work. As a Master’s student in Computational and Cognitive Linguistics at [location] State University, I have deep dived into NLP, using various tools to deal with text processing, analysis, model fine-tuning, etc. At [compaany], a [location] IT-company, I’m currently a Machine Learning Specialist, where I craft datasets, engineer prompts, evaluate neural networks—skills, and do a variety of other things.
My projects range from fine-tuning LLLMs for news headline generation to building a Django-based review analysis service deployed online. I’m comfortable with Python stacks, parsing tools, and frameworks like Flask and Django. I’ve also achieved a first-place win in the CompTech 2025 Classical ML track and a fifth-place finish in an NLP hackathon, and took part in a range of courses pertaining to NLP and AI.
What do I expect from the school? A mind-blowing mix of advanced theory, hands-on challenges, and real-world insights from experts. I’m keen to explore state-of-the-art techniques in DL, particularly in optimizing large language models and scaling AI solutions. I also hope to vibe with peers who share my passion, potentially sparking collaborations that could lead to innovative projects or even startups. The international context will sharpen my ability to communicate complex ideas across cultures.
Career-wise, I’m set on becoming a leading ML engineer, ideally with a company like [compaany], where I can contribute to transformative AI solutions. This school is a stepping stone to refine my expertise, build a global network, and position myself for roles that blend research and application. I’m all in for turning bold ideas into reality, and I see this program as the perfect launchpad.
Thank you for considering my application. I’m very excited at the prospect of joining SMILES-2025 and contributing to its vibrant community. Please feel free to reach out at [email] for any additional info.
Sincerely,
