My name is [name], and I would like to share why I am eager to join this program.
From a young age, I have been passionate about mathematics, which led me to
enroll in one of [location]'s top math schools, [company], where I immersed myself in
rigorous study and personal growth. Over time, my interest only deepened: by the
end of high school, I not only maintained my motivation but also won several
competitions, solidifying my focus on mathematics and computer science. This
made my choice of university and program obvious: Applied Mathematics and
Informatics at [company].
During my first two years, I fell in love with the beauty of fundamental mathematics
and dedicated myself tirelessly to mastering it. By the end of my second year, I
ranked 16th out of 300 students in the program. Later, I chose the specialization
“Machine Learning and Applications”, where I applied my mathematical intuition to
artificial intelligence, earning top grades in all core courses. Today, I firmly believe
that while not every aspect of machine learning can be strictly proven, it remains a
form of art—both mathematically elegant and ingeniously engineered. I was
particularly captivated by generative models, which leverage subtle statistical
techniques to map distributions of objects efficiently. Such courses have inspired me
to pursue further breakthroughs.
I thrive on generating ideas and implementing them, supported by years of honed
intuition. For example, after my second year, I joined the [company] Lab, where I am
finalizing a project on a novel statistical algorithm for estimating the operator norm
of matrices (improving the accuracy of gradient clipping). This project reaffirmed my
belief that rigorous mathematical thinking can drive meaningful contributions to
engineering challenges.
Currently, I am exploring potential research topics and have yet to settle on one. I
sincerely believe this program will help me broaden my horizons, exchange ideas
with respected professionals, and sharpen my intellectual toolkit. I hope it will guide
me toward a relevant research direction and potentially connect me with a future
academic advisor. Science is the cornerstone of my life, and I am committed to
excelling in it. While my hands-on experience is still growing, I am highly diligent,
driven, and a quick learner—complex concepts come naturally to me, and my
colleagues consistently praise my innovative ideas. The academic supervisor at the
[company] Artificial Intelligence, Center [name], and the program director of [company]
AMI, [name], can attest to this.
I am ready to dedicate myself fully to this opportunity and contribute my passion for
bridging mathematical rigor with real-world impact.
