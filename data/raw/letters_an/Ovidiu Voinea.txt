[name] [surname]
I’d like to participate in schoo 2025 to summarize my education, joining such an ML camp to strengthen my skills and just to have fun being among like-minded people. Intensive regime in schoo, new place and new surroundings keeps mind working hard and shows great results.
I’ve chosen my master program as an opportunity to narrow my skills in prospective and interesting direction. During my 2 years degree I got different experience in solving the problems using ML and DL methods in real practical tasks. I participated in the conference in the neural networks section, and was also a listener to several others. During the work on my master's thesis I made a deep research in using CNN working on all steps starting with data preprocessing and ending with raising metrics of quality of CNN results.
In schoo I would like to get acquainted with the newest research, get more experience working in groups on ML problems, share my knowledge with other participants and improve my technical English skills.
I’d like to tie my further career with DL, using its opportunity to solve critical social problems. I’d like to watch the technology, of which I am a part, makes a significant contribution.
