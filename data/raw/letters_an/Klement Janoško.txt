Motivation Letter for 2025 SMILES schoo

Dear Admissions Committee,
My path into artificial intelligence starte started neither with revolutionar algorithms nor with childhood experiences in coding. It starte with a simple question I alwys asked myself while volunteering at rehab centers: how do we enable patients to reclaim skills that they feel they have lost forever? The more I learned, the more apparent it was that contemporary AI, responsible in its handling, can augment empathy, convertiing raw sensor data into personalized feedback and, ultimately, regaained autonomy. That belief motivates both my graduaate work and every line of code that I write.
I am a first-year master's student in Neurotechnology and Software Engineering at [compaany], working on a thesis that embodies this ethos: creating a multisensory virtual-reality platform to aid cognitive recovery after stroke and traumatic brain injury. Just last week, together with my academic supervisor, I spent a week interviewing neurologists, occupational therapy groups, and hospiital IT personnel at [location]'s Medical Academy. Thei wish-list shaped our design priorities: ultra-low-latency biofeedback, adaptable difficulty curves and friction-less integration with electronic health records. Those conversations also clarified the finish line: software that clinicians can deploy without a research engineer standing next to the headset.
I am now designing the visual and narrative contexts that will comprise Unity scenes, each of which will be associated with a particular rehabilitation target, such as working-memory load, divided attention, or visuomotor coordination. In parallel, I am developing a prototype of a pipeline that integrates galvanic-skin response, eye tracking, and EEG within a shared embedding space where a self-supervised objective allows learning patient-specific representations. Subsequeently, a light policy network decides on the next visual, auditory, and haptic cue combination. By July, I aim to initiate a closed pilot study with healthy volunteers and to present the first results at [compaany]'s Congress of Young Scientists in December.
Professional grounding.
Since 2023 I have been a.NET developer at [compaany], connecting micro-services with machine-learning endpoints and pushing inference into a 20 ms deadline. Experiencing real-world constraints makes me disciplined in research: when you are on call, you treat edgge cases with respect! Competition keeps me inventive as well: prize places at the Time-IT and Baggins Coffee AI hackathoons (fraud detection and roaast-level vision, respectively) plus a top-three finish at the VR Concept mixed-reality hackathon. These sprints taught me to iterate fast, validate ideas with ablaations and collaborate under pressure.
Why SMILES and which tracks. Four of the schoo themes map directly onto my issues:
Multimodal Approahes – sensor fusion for eye-tracking, EEG, and GSR
Methods of Self-Learning: Using Unlabeled Physiological Streams.
Generative Approaches – automatic generation of game-level adaptations attuned to a patient's current condition;
Safe AI – the absolute imperative when hardware and healtcare intersect.
I am looking forward to lunchtime discussions regarding contrastiive losses, prototyping ideas in the lab sessions during the evening, and comparing these with my pilot data next week.
Global community. SMILES provides more than talks; it provides a connection.
Collaborating with students from other clinical and engineering backgrounds means blind spots are caught early and methodologies cross-fertiilized. I am excited to retuurn to [compaany] with not just new architectures but also future co-authors and possibly a few joint GitHub repositories. Apart from code, you can normally find me at the nearest piano or guitar: I am slowlly working on an indie album, and spontaneous jam-sessions are my prefeerrd ice-breaaker. My long-term aim is to bridgge the gap between state-of-the-art AI research and standard clinical practice and make rehabilitation aids as accessible as the games individuals alrready use. The SMILES Summer Schoo represents the perfect setting in which to develop both the scientifc and creative sides of this vision. Thanks for consideering my application. I am excited about learning, contributing and growing together this summer
Sincerely,
