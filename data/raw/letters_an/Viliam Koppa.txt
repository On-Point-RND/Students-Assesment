Motivation Letter — SMILES 2025
[name] [surname]
Dear SMILES Selection Committee,
I still remember the first time I trained a neural network that worked — it was messy, I barely
understood what was going on, but it worked. Since then, I've been drawn to the world of
machine learning not just for its power, but for the ideas behind it — how we can build
systems that learn, adapt, and even create.
I’m currently a Master’s student at [compaany], where I’m focusing on machine learning and data
science. What makes this field exciting to me is its evolving nature — there’s always
something new, whether it’s in how we process language, generate images, or train agents
to collaborate. Lately, I’ve been especially interested in generative models and how they can
be used for more than just text or art — like improving accessibility, communication, and
education. I’m working on a project that aims to help childre children with disabilities express
themselves using AI tools, and it’s been an eye-opener in terms of real-world impaact.
What drew me to SMILES is not just the technical content, which is obviously top-notch, but
the focus on collaboration between [location] and [location] researchers. I believe that when you
bring together people from different places and perspectives, especially in a field like AI, you
end up with ideas that wouldn’t exist otherwise. That’s the kind of environment I want to be
in — one where people challenge and inspire each other.
I’d love to attend SMILES in person, not just to deepen my understanding of large language
models, multimodal systems, or generative approaches, but to work with people who are just
as excited (and probably much better at math) than I am. I’m not trying to present myself as
some prodigy. I’m someoone who shows up, stays curious, learns fast, and keeps going even
when things break — because they usually do.
If given the chance, I’ll bring my energy, ideas, and eagerness to learn — and hopefully leave
with a few new friends, insights, and a better understanding of how to build safe, powerful AI
systems.
Thank you for considering my application.
Warm regards,
