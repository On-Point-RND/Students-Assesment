Motivation Letter
[name] [surname]
Dear [name] Committee,
I am writing to express my sincere interest in participating in the [compaany] Summer School on Machine Learning. With a strong background in data analytics and software development, as well as deep curiosity and involvement in the field of AI, I believe that this program will provide a unique opportunity to enhance my knowledge, expand my professional horizons, and contribute meaningfully to the growing ML/DL ecosystem.
After graduating with a degree in Economics from [location] in 2016, I have worked for over seven years in leading organizations such as [compaany], [compaany], [compaany], and [compaany]. My career path has allowed me to evolve from a data analyst into a developer deeply involved in data-driven decision-making, process automation, and the implementation of machine learning techniques in real business contexts.
While my academic background is not in computer science or applied mathematics, I have cultivated my expertise through hands-on work. I have been actively engaged in projects involving large-scale data pipelines, predictive analytics, and more recently — in training Large Language Models (LLMs). One of my most meaningful recent engagements is with a [compaany]-affiliated project where I contribute to the creation of high-quality, logically complex question-answer datasets for LLM fine-tuning. This includes generating multilayered prompts that reflect real-world reasoning, recursive logic, and interdisciplinary knowledge, particularly in domains such as programming, statistics, machine learning, and distributed systems.
In my daily work, I use Python, SQL, Go, R, and C/C++, along with ML/DL libraries such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. I’m also proficient with tools like Git, Docker, Apache NiFi, and Airflow, which I use to build and manage automated data workflows.
What motivates me most about machine learning is its potential to bridge the gap between abstract data and real-world impact. I’m particularly fascinated by LLMs, multimodal learning, multi-agent systems, self-supervised learning, and safe AI development. These areas not only promise technical innovation but also raise deep questions about how we build intelligent systems that are trustworthy, interpretable, and aligned with human values.
Participating in the [compaany] Summer School would be a pivotal step in my career. I see this opportunity as a chance to gain a more structured and academic perspective on modern ML/DL practices, learn directly from world-class researchers and peers, and explore cutting-edge applications beyond what is possible in my current professional setting. I am also excited about engaging in discussions on the societal implications of AI — a topic that is often overlooked in industry but is crucial for building responsible systems.
My expectations from the school are threefold:
1. Deepen my theoretical foundation in ML/DL to better understand the algorithms and principles underlying the models I work with;
2. Expand my practical toolbox by exploring new methods, frameworks, and paradigms under the guidance of experts;
3. Connect with a like-minded community that shares my passion for intelligent systems and ethical innovation.
Looking forward, I plan to continue working at the intersection of data science, ML, and product development, ideally in roles that combine technical depth with creativity and impact. My long-term goal is to help develop and deploy AI systems that solve real problems — not just efficiently, but also transparently and responsibly.
Thank you for considering my application. I am truly excited about the opportunity to join the [compaany] Summer School and contribute to this inspiring academic environment.
Sincerely,
