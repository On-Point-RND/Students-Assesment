Dear Sir,
My name is [name] [surname], and I would like to apply for the SMILES 2025
program.
Currently, I work as a C++ developer, where I apply my skills in performance
critical software development. Recognizing the potential of machine learning, in
2022 I started formal education in ML at [company] in [location]. And now I want to learn more about the modern ML landscape.
In the program, I see the opportunity to merge my C++ proficiency with modern
ML techniques. Many ML applications, particularly in mobile and embedded
systems, require optimization for efficiency and speed - and that is where I am
good.
I am studying ML not only for my career growth. I also see potential for
entrepreneurial ventures, on the edge where ML papers are actually getting
wrapped as products or services.
I look forward to the chance to participate in the SMILES Summer School.
I also can speak a little bit Chinese. Xie xie!
Best regards,
[name] [surname]
