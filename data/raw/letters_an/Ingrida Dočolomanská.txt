Dear [name] [surname] Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my strong motivation to participate in the SMILES Summer Schoo l on Machine Learning. As an ML researcher with over three years of professional experience, I am
eager to deepen my knowl edge, exchange ideas with peers and experts, and advance my career
in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Curr ently, I work at [compaany], where I have developed and deployed machine learning
pipelines in computer vision, reinforcement learning, and large language models. In computer
vision, I designed a production pipeline for semantic segmentation of forest species using state-
of-the-art architectures such as EfficientNet+DeepLabv3, Vision Transforme rs, and Swin
Transforme rs. I also opti mized data loading and processing, accelerating model training by 15%,
and implemented a self-supervised pretraining pipeline that improved segmentation quality by
10%. In reinforcement learning, I created training and testing pipelines for quadcopter stabiliza tion
and navigation using PPO and SAC algo rithm s, and applied Generative Adve rsiarial Imitation
Learning (GAIL) to train a virtual pilot agent with 80% expert behavio r imitation. I'm curre ntly
working on writing an article to consolidate my results. Addit ionally, I developed a Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG) system with web search capabilities based on LLaMA 3.1 and
LangChain. My experience managing a team of over three peo ple has honed my skills in task
pla nning, technical analysis, and quality control to meet deadlines effe ctively.
My academic background includes a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer science and control systems,
Information systems and telecommunications from Bauman Moscow State Technical Uni versi ty,
where I focused on recurrent multi-agent reinforcement learning methods in the game Starcraft
2. I have also completed advanced courses in Python programming and global opti mization
methods rel evant to machine learning.
I am motivated to join SMILES to enhance my theoretica l understanding and practical skills,
particularly in cutting-e dg e ML/DL methods and their applications. I look fo rward to engaging with
leading researchers and peers, gaining exposure to new tools and frameworks, and applying
these insights to my ongoing projects and future research.
My career goal is to become a leading ML researcher specializing in reinforcement learning and
computer vision, contributing to inn ovative AI solutions with real-wor ld im pact. Parti cipation in
SMILES will be instrumental in achi eving this by expanding my experti se, networ k, and research
capabilities.
Thank you for conside ring my application. I am excited about the opport unity to learn and grow
at SMILES.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
