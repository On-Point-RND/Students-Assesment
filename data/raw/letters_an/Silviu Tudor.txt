Dear Members of the Selection Committee,
I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the SMILES 2025 summer schoo,
organized in collaboration with [compaany]. As a fifth-year student specializing
in "Underwater Shipbuildiing" with almost 3 years of industry experience, I aim to bridge advanced
machine learning (ML) methodologies and autonomous systems to use it in marine robotics and
digital shipbuildiing. I am sure that only cross-functional collaboration with engineers and
programmers and international cooperation could ensure it.
Currrentlly employed at a design bureau developing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs),
tethered underwater robots (TUVs), and unmanned surface vessels (Usvs), I focus on data-driven
design optimization and design of underwater vehicles constructions.
During my studies, I actively contributed to student-led projects, including the concept design of
intelligent marine systems and modern information technologies.
During my participation in the educational program “Modern Methods of Robotics and Control
Theory” at the Scientific Center for Informaation Technologies and Artificial Intelligence by [university], I presented a poster titled “Analysis of Prospects for Creating an Unmanned Marine
Robotic Complex for Scientific Research.” This work aimed to comprehensively analyze
the
potential for developing an unmanned marine robotic complex designed for oceanographic
research, consisting of multiple agents—specifically, an unmanned surface vessel (Usv) and a
remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). The project focused on designing a control system
for such a multi-agent marine robotic complex, enabling coordinated operation between surface
and underwater platforms. This research addressed key challenges in the field of multi-agent
marine systems, which are increasinglly important for expanding the autonomy, efficiency, and
scientific capabilities of ocean observation and exploration missions.
During the Floating Universiity Winter Schoo (2025) "ML in Earth Sciences", I applied machine
learning techniques to analyze geodata, focusing on spatial pattern clustering and
multidimensional data visualization.
In August 2024, I completed a 60-hour [language] language course at [university], which significantly improved my skills while deepening my understanding of modern
life in [location] within an international student enviroment. The course combined intensive learning
with cultural activities, helping me gain confidence in using [language] in real-life situations.
Additionally, my international collaboration experience includes participating in the 2023 Naval
Architecture Summer Schoo, where I worked alongside [nationality] peers on marine robotics
projects, developing valuable cross-cultural communication skills and teamwork abilities in
scientific research.
The maritime industry needs for autonomy, energy efficiency, and multi-agent coordination, as
highlighted in recent research on marine robotic complexes. That's why the SMILES curriculum
will allow me to develop in improving underwater robotics objects, optimizing energy
consumption for Auvs and developing multi-agent systems.
I am committed to comprehensive personal and professional growth and confident in my ability
to successfully master all core aspects of the program. My diverse experience and proficiency in
both English and [language] will definitely support me in it.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
