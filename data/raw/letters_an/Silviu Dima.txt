Motivation Letter – SMILES‑2025 Summer Schoo l
Dear Members of the SMILES‑2025 Selection Committee,
My name is [name], and I am completing the final semester of an M.Sc. in Data Science at [compaany]. My master’s thesis—
“Graph RAG‑Based Knowl edge System for Topologica l Graph‑Based Visual Navigation”—combines open‑vocabulary computer vision, knowl edge‑graph
construction and large lan guage models (LLMs) so that a mobile robot can build a semantic map of its surroundings, answer natural‑lan guage questions and plan routes without relying on classical metric maps. The system employs Groundi ng DINO, Detic
and Segment Anyth ing for detection and segm entation, CLIP‑style embeddings for visual representation and an LLM‑driven retrieval‑augm ented generation pipeline for
multi‑hop reasoning. I am now preparing a full paper on these results for submis sion to
an international robotics and AI conference.
Why SMILES‑2025
The focus areas of SMILES‑2025—large lan guage models, multimodal app roaches,
generative methods, self‑supervised learning, safe AI and multi‑agent systems—align
perfectly with my current work and future plans.
• LLMs and multimodality. My prototype alr eady uses an LLM as both a retriever
and high‑level pla nner, yet I still need deeper experti se in grounding and
alignment.
• Generative techniques. I explore natural‑lan gua ge plan generation and
diffusion‑based scene synthesis for simulation‑to‑real transfer; the schoo l’s
lectures will sharpen these skills.
• Self‑supervised and safe AI. Understanding data‑efficient training and safety
gua rantees is vital when an LLM controls a physical agent.
• Multi‑agent systems. My long‑term goal is a fleet of robots that exchange graph
memories; insights into coo rdination and trust are therefore essen tial.
Experience and Contribution
Over five years of intensi ve work with Python and PyTorch I have built the full
detection‑segm entation‑graph‑RAG s tack, deployed it on NVIDIA Jetson hard ware, and
served as a teaching assistant for the Skoltech course “Deep Learning for Robotics.” I
co‑mentored two undergra dua te capstone projects and led the winning team in the
Embodied‑AI track of Skolkovo AI Hack 2023.
At SMILES I am ready to:
• Present a poster and lightning talk on my GraphRAG navigation system, sharing
code and datasets.
• Assis t peers during the hacka thon with debugging model pipelines and setting
up eva luation tools.
• Volunt eer for organi sational tasks or evening workshops to strengthen the
schoo l’s colla borative spirit.
Learning Goals
I hope to master advanced pr ompt‑tuning and retrieval strategies for LLM‑guided
multimodal generation, learn cutting‑e dg e self‑supervised pre‑training schemes, and
adopt best practices for eva luating and securing generative agents in real‑worl d
enviro nments. These insights will help finalise my paper, refine my prototype and
prepar e me for a PhD focused on safe multimodal LLMs for autonomous robots—and
later for launching a start‑up that offers explai nable inspection robots.
