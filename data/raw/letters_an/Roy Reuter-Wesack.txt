Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my interest in participating in the Skoltech Summer
School of Machine Learning (SMILES). Having recently completed my Master’s
degree in Computer and Applied Linguistics at [location], I am
now preparing to apply for PhD programs. This summer school represents an
opportunity for me to refine my research direction and engage with cutting-edge
advancements in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language
processing. My academic and professional journey, rooted in the intersection of
language, technology, and human behavior, has led me to seek clarity on how
to align my interdisciplinary interests with the evolving landscape of AI – a goal I
hope to achieve through SMILES.
My academic background began with a Bachelor’s degree in
Fundamental and Applied Linguistics at [location], where I explored
how voice assistants like Siri and Alisa respond to emotional stimuli. Analysing
hundreds of interactions, I discovered patterns in their limitations – how they often
struggled to convey empathy or adapt to cultural nuances. This work ignited my
curiosity about bridging the gap between rigid algorithmic responses and the
fluidity of human communication. Later, during my Master’s program, I shifted
focus to sociolinguistics, developing models to automatically extract
sociolinguistic data from diaries in the “Prozhito” project. This project was not just
technical; it felt like uncovering layers of history through language. Training neural
networks to detect subtle cues – like how age, gender influenced vocabulary
choices in diaries – taught me the transformative potential of ML in humanities
research.
Professionally, I’ve sought opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge to
real-world challenges. At the Speech Technology Center, I contributed to
developing a Java-based chatbot for the Gosuslugi Portal. While designing
dialogue flows, I encountered unexpected user behavior – phrases like “My
passport drowned” instead of formal requests – highlighting the need for systems
that accommodate human unpredictability. This experience reinforced my belief
that robust NLP solutions must balance technical precision with an understanding
of pragmatic language use.
Currently, as a Junior ML Engineer at [company], I work on an advertising
quality system for Telegram channels. My tasks range from fine-tuning BERT models
to detect subtle negativity in texts to optimising hybrid search systems that
combine traditional methods like TF-IDF, BM25 with vector databases like FAIASS.
One particularly rewarding project involved building an LLM-agent with RAAG
system to get similar advertising campaigns based on user briefs.
Simultaneously, I am involved in a grant project at [location],
where we analyse everyday communication patterns using transformers. By
studying recordings of casual conversations – like debates over household chores
or interactions at office – we aim to model how factors influence speech. For
instance, predicting whether a speaker is a student or retiree is both technically
intriguing and ethically complex. This work has deepened my interest in
developing AI systems that respect linguistic diversity while addressing biases.
Despite these experiences, I find myself at a crossroads. While industry work
is stimulating, I miss the creative autonomy to pursue foundational questions that
span both technical and sociolinguistic dimensions: How can ML models better
capture cultural and situational context without prohibitive computational costs?
Can we design LLMs that not only replicate human speech but also preserve
underrepresented dialects through resource-efficient architectures? For instance,
in my recent work on predicting authors’ demographic traits from diary texts, I
experimented with dynamic embedding integration – adjusting embeddings
based on contextual metadata like time period or regional vocabulary – to
improve model accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. This
project, presented at the Yandex-HSE NLP laboratory, involved iterating on
architectures for binary and multiclass classification, which deepened my interest
in balancing technical constraints (e.g., latency, memory usage) with
sociolinguistic goals. Answering these questions requires a return to academia,
but first, I need clarity on how to align my dual interests in architectural innovation
and human-centric NLP. SMILES becomes pivotal here, offering a space to
explore emerging methods like sparse attention mechanisms or adaptive
computation while refining frameworks that harmonise technical feasibility with
ethical design.
The summer school’s emphasis on hands-on projects and interdisciplinary
collaboration resonates deeply with my goals. I am particularly drawn to the
opportunity to experiment with emerging techniques in a setting that encourages
creative risk-taking. For example, I would love to prototype a model that
integrates sociolinguistic metadata (e.g., regional dialects, age-related speech
patterns) into LLM fine-tuning processes, potentially improving their adaptability
to diverse user groups. Additionally, workshops on ethical AI and interpretability
could provide frameworks for addressing the bias challenges I’ve interested in.
Beyond technical skills, I hope to connect with peers and mentors who
share my enthusiasm for domains like LLMs, multimodal systems, and generative
AI – areas I’ve only recently begun exploring but am deeply motivated to master.
I’m inspired by SMILES’ unique blend of visionary speakers and hands-on learning.
Collaborating with researchers from different backgrounds at SMILES could spark
similar breakthroughs. At SMILES, I want to immerse myself in this synergy of ideas
– whether during workshops, informal debates, or mentorship sessions.
In conclusion, I view SMILES as more than a summer program – it is a catalyst
for the next phase of my academic journey. The chance to learn from leading
researchers, engage in collaborative projects, and immerse myself in Skoltech’s
innovation-driven environment would provide the inspiration and direction I need
to transition.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honoured to join SMILES
and am confident that this experience will equip me to tackle the challenges and
opportunities at the forefront of AI and language technology.
Sincerely,
