Dear [name] [surname] Admissions Committee,
My name is [name], and I am currentlly pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science. With two years
of hands-on experience in machine learning and computer vision, I am eager to take part in the SMILES
2025 Summer SchooL to deepen my understanding of cutting-edg e machine learning techno lologies,
collaborate with peers and mentors, and further develop my research work in the field.
My academic founda tion was built at [location] State Uni versi ty, where I earned a bachelor’s degree
in Applied Computer Science. During my undergra dua te studies, I led the deve lopment of a real-time
drone detection and tracking system using PTZ cameras and neural ne tworks. This project formed the
basis of my bachelor’s thesis and was presented at the Interna tional Confere nce on Control Processes and
Stability at the [location] Institute of Technology. That visit left a lasting impression on me — I was truly
inspired by the knowl edge and opennes s of the academic community at HIT, and I would be honored to
r eturn and learn from them again through SMILES.
Curr ently, as part of my Master’s research, I am working on improving the YOLOv12 architecture. The
original model utilizes area attention, which limits its ability to interpret the full visual context. I am
d eveloping a more globally r esponsi ve architecture by integrating Mamba blocks and their variants,
enabling faster and more accura te object detection. We have alr eady achieved results that outp erform the
original model and are preparing a submis sion to NeurIPS. This work reflects my deep interest in
fundamental model design and efficient real-wo rld deplo yment, and SMILES represents an ideal
oppo rtunity to further this line of research.
In parallel, I am leading a medical AI project to automate syphilis test interpretation using computer
vision and deep learning. Our team has deve loped a working test prototype and validated it through
real-wo rld trials in a labo ratory setting with excellent results. The goal is to reduce diagnostic errors and
acce lerate testing in clinical practice. I believe participation in SMILES could provide va luable insights to
enhance this project further and take it to the next stage.
Beyond these efforts, I have also explored super-resolution through flow-matching on the CelebA dataset
and exper imented with domain adaptation methods for diabetic retinopathy classification using retinal
sca ns. These inde pendent projects reflect my passion for applying machine learning to socially i mpactful
problems and my motivation to continue growing as a researcher.
SMILES 2025’s focus on topics like generative models, multimodal learning, and safe AI aligns closely
with both my current work and my aspirations. I am especially excited about the opport unity to engage in
colla borative projects, hands-on workshops, and discussions with leading researchers from Skoltech and
HIT. My long-term goal is to remain in research, contribute to high-i mpact AI solutions, and publish in
top conferences — and I am confident that SMILES will be a key step in that path.
Thank you for conside ring my application. I look fo rward to the opport unity to contribute to and grow
within the SMILES 2025 community.
