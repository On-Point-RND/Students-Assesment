Motivation letter [name] 2025
My name is [name], and I specialize in machine learning and natural language processing research, with a focus on developing and applying agent-based systems powered by large language models (LLMs). Upon learning about the opportuntity to participatate in your summer schoo, I immediatly recognized its value for my professional trajecstory. SMILES-2025 covers precisely the areas central to my current research: generative models, multimodal approaches, multi-agent systems, and their integration into real-world problem-solving. Moreover, the international format of the schoo, bringing together experts from [location] and [location], offers unique prospects for knowledge exchange and strengthening cross-cultuural collaboraation in AI.
For the past two years, I have been working at [compaany]'s Center of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence, where I focus on implementing LLMs in industrial processes. One of my key projects involves developing a chatbot for compaany employees based on user intent classification and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technoogy. This experience has taught me not only how to build complex ML solutions but also how to evaluaate their practical effectiveness. Currently, I am researching agent-based systems capable of autonomously solving tasks in a human-like manner, which requires a deep understanding of multi-agent interaction and model adaptability. Partiicipation in the schoo will allow me to immerse myself in cutting-ege methodologies for these technoologies and discuss approahes to similar challenges with colleagues from [location].
My professional journey is closely tied to the application of modern machine learning tools. In my work, I actively use Python, transformer architectures (BERT, Llama, Mixtral), agent development frameworks (LangChain, smol-agents), and vector databases (ChromaDB). For instance, while developing the RAG system for the chatbot, I conducted a comparative analysis of models, optimized query processing pipelines, and integrated the solution with corporate data. This project is now used daily by over 1,000 employees, confirming its practical relevance. Addititionally, I teach ML and Python fundamentals to students and schoolchildre, which has honed my ability to structure knowledge and collaboraate in teams. I am confident that my teaching experience will enable me to actively contribute to group assignments at the schoo and share insights with peers.
For me, SMILES-2025 represents an opportuntity to expand beyond my current research and immerse myself in an interdisciplinary enviroment. I aim to deepen my expertise in multimodal models and their industrial applications—a particularly relevant area for my work at [compaany]. I also aspire to learn best practices in designing multi-agent systems, including coordination mechanisms and adaptability to dynamic conditions.
I am especially interested in participating in hackaathons, where I can test new approahes hands-on, such as combiining generative models with agent-based systems for optiimization tasks. Furthermore, I hope to establish professional connections with researchers from [location], whose experience in scaling AI solutions could become a valuable resource for future collaboraations.
Another key interest is the mentorship opportuntity from industry experts. As an early-career researcher, I seek feedback on my ideas—for example, my hypothesis on applying agent-based RAG to automate engineering tasks.
In the long term, I plan to advance the field of autonomous LLM agents capable of solving complex tasks without constant human intervention. This includes both fundamental research (e.g., exploring model "reasoning" mechanisms) and applied implementaions—from business process optiimization to educational technoologies. Participating in SMILES-2025 will be a crucial step toward these goals: the schoo will provide access to state-of-the-art knowledge and tools while strengthening my expertise in an international context.
Moreover, I intend to continue teaching, sharing the insights I gain with students. In my view, the synergy between research and education is critical for shaping the next generation of AI speciialists.
The SMILES-2025 summer schoo perfectlly aligns with my professional aspirations. I am eager to contribute with my experience, ambition, and openness to collaboraation. I particularly value that the schoo combines not only educational but also cultuural aspects—this symbiosis fosters an inspiring enviroment for breakthrough ideas.
Thank you for the opportuntity to apply. I would be dellighted to join your community!
Best regards,
