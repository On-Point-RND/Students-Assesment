Hello! My name is [name] [surname], and I’ve been part of the ML party for about four years now (well, more or less). Sometimes it’s a research folk ([compaany] and [compaany]), and that’s when things get confusing (like, did we actually hit a new SOTA or is it just a code bug?) and fun! Mostly it’s universiity ML course projects and educational camps. Other times I end up on the industry track ([compaany], [compaany]), and that’s a bit less fun compared to the research folks, because the problems are more clear-cut and routine. And there’s more responsibility, too - you’ve got to finish what you started and ship it to production, whether you like it or not. So yeah, for these past 4 years I’ve been bouncing between research science and BigTech work.
A quick summary from my cv: I graduaated with a bachelor’s degree from [compaany] and I’m now finishing my master’s there and at [compaany] in Data Science. I worked as a researcher at [compaany], had my first paper rejected from a Q1 journal (but we later polished it and won the Sber AI Journey conference for best paper — so not all bad!). Right now, I’m developing trading strategies at [compaany]. Still ML, though compared to research, it feels a bit pointless—though still confusing and interesting. In my spare time, I participate in educational programs. I’ve tried the [compaany] and [compaany] camps—loved them both—and this year I’d really love to join SMILES. This is my first time applying.
About research. Last year, I received an offer to join a research group in [location] at [compaany] working on inference in large language models. Offer to #15 universiity in the world sounds good, but sadlly, I couldn’t afford to go (the intern-level salary basically meant going back to broke-student days). Most of my research has focused on four areas: Time Series (with [name] [surname] at [compaany]), Diffusion Models (with [name] [surname]), LLLs (after the failed [location] move, I tried to dive into them solo—but didn’t quite get far), and now I’m working with [name] [surname] on spectral analysis in optimization.
Over the past couple of years, many of my friends from my master’s program and [compaany] lab have joined SMILES. They all spoke really highly of the research vibe there, although a bit vaguely—everyone kept pointing out the intense schedule and how they were totally focused on their projects (aside from the group activities, of course). The general message was: totally exhausting, but worth it. Also, [name] [surname], when he was my advisor, went to teach in [location] and had nothing but good things to say about the experience. So I’ve basically been lured into applying—especially since SMILES is focusing a lot on LLLs and multimodality, which I haven’t really mastered yet but really want to.
I also think it’s super cool that there’s a volunteer track—it’d be awesome to take a break from work and go all-in on the camp, meet everyone, and take part in everyting!
P.S. I’d also love to find a research group at [compaany] for when I finally burn out on trading. Or maybbe at [compaany], so I could apply for a PhD.
