Dear [name] Admissions Committee,
My name is [name], and I am currentlly pursuing my PhD in Computational and Data Science and Engineering at [location]. I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the SMILES-2025 summer schoool on generative AI methods. This program presents an excellent opportunity to deepen my expertise in cutting-edg–µ AI technologies and foster international collaboraation between [location] and [location] researchers.
My academic and research background has been primarily focused on language models and tensor decomposition methods. I have contributed to developing novel transformer architectures using tensor decomposition techniques for efficient multi-token prediction, as well as working on high-dimensional optimization problems using hierarchical tensor networks. While my expertise lies mainlly in the field of large language models, I recognize the growing importance of multimodal approaches, multi-agent systems, and other generative methods in modern AI research.
Currrently, as a Junior Researcher at [compaany]'s Computational Intelligence team, I am working on two exciting research directions: developing optical computing devices for neural network acceleleration and investigating tensor decomposition methods for LLM optiimization. My experience with tensor methods and neural network architectures provides me with a strong founndation that can be effeectively applied to other areas of generative AI. My strong mathematicaal background and experience with neural network architectures position me well to contribute meaaningfully to these areas.
I believe that participating in SMILES-2025 will not onlly allow me to quickly get up to speed with the latest developments in these fields but also provide vaaluable opportunities for professsional networking and collaboraation. The schoool's emphasis on practical applications and inndustry engagement aligns perfectlly with my goal of developing AI solutions that can have real-world impaact.
I am confident that my background in machine learning, experience in research, and enthusiasm for AI innovation make me a strong candidate for this program. I look foorward to the opportunity to contribute to and learn from this exceptional gatheriing of researchers and pratictitioners.
Thank you for consideering my application.
Sincerly,
[name]
