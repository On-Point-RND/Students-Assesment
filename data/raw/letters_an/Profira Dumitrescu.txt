Dear Admissions Committee of SMILES Machine Learning Summer School 2025,
Thank you for your hard work in the organization of the Summer School and providing students like me with the opportunity to apply. I am eager to participate in this event as it is a crucial opportunity for me to deepen my knowledge about Machine Learning that I am very passionate about.
I am currently completing the last semester of my undergraduate Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Physics at [compaany] at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Sciences and searching for academic opportunities for my future studies.
Additionally, this semester I am concluding a 2.5-year Data Science program that included advanced courses in causal inference, A/B testing, applied mathematical statistics, time series analysis, natural language processing, computer vision, generative models, reinforcement learning, sound processing, Bayesian machine learning and statistics, and recommender systems. This program, offered in collaboration with the [compaany] of Data Analysis ([location]), has provided me with a solid foundation in these subjects and extensive practical experience addressing complex problems.
In addition to gaining knowledge at university courses I also wanted to gain practical experience. This led me to engage in a research internship at the Cognitive Modelling Center at [compaany] in the Cognitive Dynamic Systems Lab, focusing on the application of large language models in Embodied AI in April 2024. In February 2025, I was promoted to a staff position of lab technician and continue working there to the present day. Under the supervision of [name], head of the Embodied Agents Department at [compaany], and [name], head of the Cognitive AI Systems Lab at [compaany], my work has concentrated on the following areas:
1. Investigating how large language models process ambiguities and contributing to the development of a dataset exploring their perception of uncertainty.
2. Developing a planning module using a service-oriented architecture that leverages large language model capabilities and scene graphs to enable real-time replanning.
3. Creating a solution for Visual Language Navigation by employing a Visual Language Action model pretraining approach with Embodied reasoning in the search for ways to improve performance on established VLN simulators.
Also I wanted to help younger students to grasp challenging concepts in machine learning and statistics. This led to me becoming an assistant for second- and third-year students in courses such as “Introduction to Data Analysis,” “Machine Learning,” and “Applied Mathematical Statistics” in my fourth year of university.
In addition to that, my work experience includes serving as a Backend Python Developer and ML Engineer at [compaany] on ThetaGrader, a project aimed at implementing LLM solutions for auto-grading student work submitted via ipynb files. This role provided me with experience in MLOps, deploying LLMs on servers, handling data storage, and applying CI/CD methodologies.
Furthermore, all the work experience mentioned above, as well as my Hackathon participation (as detailed in my CV), have strengthened my teamwork skills, which will be highly beneficial at the Summer School.
I am committed to building a career within the international scientific community, and participating in this program would be a significant step toward that goal, as well as an incredibly valuable experience for me as an aspiring scientist. To prepare further for this path, I have improved my English language skills, achieving an overall score of 8 on the Academic IELTS in January 2025.
I sincerely hope that my CV and the qualifications outlined above clearly demonstrate my dedication and deep passion for the projects I undertake. I am confident that my academic background and skill set will allow me to contribute meaningfully to the highly collaborative environment of the SMILES Summer School.
Finally, the opportunity to visit [location] and the [location] Institute of Technology excites me tremendously. Beyond the primary goal of learning from the event’s esteemed speakers, I would love to experience the customs of [location], a place I have never visited before.
I genuinely thank you for your time and consideration and look forward to the committee admission verdict. Please feel free to contact me via provided email for any additional information.
Best regards,
