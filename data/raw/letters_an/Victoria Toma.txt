Dear [name] [surname] Organizing Committee,
My name is [name] [surname]. I am a s[number] year PhD student at [compaany]. I am currently transferring from the "[program name]" program to the "[program name]" program to focus on generative AI for construction engineering and architecture applications. I want to participate in the SMILES 2025 to enhance my knowledge of multimodal approaches and multi-agent systems in generative AI.
My research bridges AI and real-world engineering challenges, particularly in additive manufacturing (Specialist Engineering degree, MS and previous program PhD's studies) and generative design for construction (current PhD research). I developed a multimodal defect detection system for Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) that synchronizes acoustic signals and optical imaging to predict anomalies in real time. I then explored text-to-BIM (Building Information Modelling) generation. I worked with industry partners to transform textual descriptions into structured 3D architectural models.
The SMILES Summer School’s will perfectly fit my goals. I want to apply advanced techniques for cross-modality in constructive design. My current research on text-to-BIM generation in construction needs the usage of new methods combination in diffusion models, LLM-based code generation (for Industry Foundation Classes code generation), and multi-agent systems for iterative design refinement. I want to know more about how these technologies can be applied in these real-world settings.
Speaking of ML/DL experience I developed a defect prediction system for additive manufacturing using transformer architectures for image analysis and signal processing for acoustic data in laser-based additive manufacturing. After that I contributed to text-to-BIM pipelines, experimenting with diffusion models for BIM and CAD models generation and transformer-based code synthesis for parametric design. Worked with large multimodal datasets ([compaany]'s BIM repositories).
During this school I hope to participate in a project with real-world data to use the LLMs for structured output generation (e.g., text-to-code, text-to-3D), learn multi-agent frameworks for collaborative design tasks, with feedback and network with peers and mentors to explore applications of these methods in smart manufacturing and AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction).
After my PhD, I aim to work at the intersection of AI research and industrial applications, either in academia or industrial R&D. My long-term goal is to develop interpretable, multimodal AI systems that enhance human creativity and precision in engineering—e.g., generative design tools for sustainable construction or adaptive manufacturing control.
SMILes would provide the perfect foundation to advance these ambitions. Thank you for your consideration—I would be thrilled to contribute to and learn from this community.
Best regards,
