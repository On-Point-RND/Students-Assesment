Dear [name],
My name is [name], and I am a 2023 graduate of the Computer Science Department's Applied Mathematics and ComputerScience program at [location]. This letter is being written to express my keen desire to be enrolled in the SMILES-2025 -The Skoltech Summer School of Machine Learning. Having explored the program’s curriculum and research focus, I am confident that SMILES-2025 is the perfect opportunity to deepen my expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence, aligning with my academic and career aspirations. I am eager to contribute my analytical skills and passion for AI while learning from leading researchers in the field.
I have accumulated significant professional experience in machine learning and natural language processing since graduating. I have developed numerous projects, ranging from model building and training to their deployment in production. I have developed action-driven solutions with measurable outcomes. I have led end-to-end projects my entire career, from designing technical architecture to deploying and optimizing for production smoothly. Alternating between bleeding-edge experimentation and the need for solid, stable solutions has been an integral part of my career. Moreover, as a contributor to product teams, I've spent time developing features that improved user interfaces and had a direct effect on business metrics. This further developed my understanding of machine learning in practical application beyond the technical and reinforced my interest in further venturing into this area.
While I’ve developed a solid foundation in machine learning through my studies, I’m eager to deepen my understanding of both theoretical principles and modern advancements in the field. SMILES-2025’s unique combination of rigorous coursework, hands-on projects, and collaboration with leading researchers aligns perfectly with my aspirations. I'll use this program to build the technical foundation and vision required to drive progress in AI and emerge as a leader.
Another aspect that attracted me most about this program is the academic team. The faculty members of this program are leading professionals in the field of machine learning, and what they do has a significant impact on our knowledge of how to work with artificial intelligence. It is also comforting to know that the program collaborates with Skoltech, where new innovative technologies and techniques are being developed. This is one of the main opportunities to learn about the latest innovations in IT and machine learning.
In short, I’m thrilled by the opportunity to participate in SMILES-2025. I’m eager to learn from world-leading researchers, collaborate with a diverse community of peers, and develop the cutting-edge skills needed to contribute meaningfully to machine learning. Thank you for your time and consideration—I would be honored to join this program.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
