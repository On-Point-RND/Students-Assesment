Dear [name],
I am writing to express my strong motivation to participat in the Summer SchooL of Machine
Learning at [location]. As a current student of Applied Mathematics and
Informatics at the [university] and the founder and CEO of a tech startup focused on
inclusive education, I have cultivate a deep passion for machine learning and generative
methods. [location]’s unique combination of cutting-e dg electures, hands-on workshops,
hackatho ns, and international collabora tion aligns perfectly with both my academic background
and professional ambitions.
My journey into artificial intelligence began with my admission to the master's program in
Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (Financial Mathematics and Financial
Technologies) at [university]. Over the past two years, I have been diving deep into data
science and realized that this is the field I want to develop in further. My primary area of interest
is algo rithmic trading—an area where mathematicians and developers have increasi ngly taken
the lead over traditional economi sts.
I am particularly fascinated by the use of machine learning to design algo rithmic trading
strategi es. Buildi ng succe ssful and efficient strategies requires analyzing massi ve volumes of
data and identi fying complex relationships—something far beyon d human capabilities without
automation. Yet, I believe humans still play an important role, as their strategies are interpretable
and context-aware. My goal is to bridg e these two worlds by creating models that can understand
user intent and deliver high-perfo rming, interpretable results.
I’m also keen on exploring the application of ML in strategies based on derivative financial
instruments—especially options. These strategies are often compu ta tionally intensi ve,
particularly in the case of exotic options that lack closed-form pricing formulas. Here, numerical
methods like finite differences or Monte Carlo simulations become essen tia l. I believe this area
has enormous poten tia l for innovation.
Another field I’m passionate about is the use of neural ne tworks for sign lan gua ge recognition.
During my bachelor’s degree in Innovation Studies, I gained practical experience in innovati ve
proje ct management and founde d my own star tup, where I c urrently serve as CEO. Within this
proje ct, we deve loped an educational program for Russian Sign Lan gua ge, which includes
lectures, themed and personalized dictionar ies, an educational game, and an alphabet/number
module. The program is a vai lable both as a website and as an Android app.
This initia tive has won several national grants and awards and has gone through three
accele rator programs. The next step in the star tup’s deve lopment is to create a ge stu re recognition system
using camera input. This would significa ntly improve both the quality of education and the
quality of life for deaf and hard-of-hearing p eo ple. The poten tia l applications are wide-ranging—
from education to customer service and more.
Throug hout my academic and profes sional journey, I have gained hands-on experience with
various machine learning tools and techniques:
• Python Ecosystem: Regular use of pandas, NumPy, SciPy for data processing and
scienti fic compu ting, and Matpl olib and Seaborn for visualization.
• Modeling with scikit-learn: Experience buildi ng and eva lua ting linear/logisti c
regres sion models, decision trees, and PCA for dime nsionality reduction.
• Quantitative Research & Simulation: Implemented Monte Carlo simulations for option
pricing using low-di screpancy sequences (Van der Corput, Halton, Sobol) to enhance
convergence. Deve loped finite-diffe rence methods (explicit and implicit) to price barrier
and loo kback options.
• Algo rithmic Trading Infrastructure: Designed a modular system for constructing and
analyz ing alpha s ignals from [location] futures data, including por tfolio opti mization under
different weighti ng schemes.
• Reinforce ment Learning: As part of a scienti fic reproduction inten sive by [compa ny], I
reproduced a state-of-the-art RL algo rithm for opti mal trade execution in dynami cally
liquid markets, which deepened my understanding of reproducibility and robus t
experimenta tion.
From [location], I hope to gain new knowl edge—but more importa ntly, to immerse myself in an
enviro nment full of energy and enthusiasm. I’m looking fo rward to meeting new p eo ple, sharing
experiences, and learning from others. I am also very excited about the opport unity to visit
[country], explore its cu lture and tra ditions, and see firsthand its techno logica l advancements.
In the future, I envision myself working as a quantitative analyst, ideally at a global quantitative
finance firm. I’m fascinated by how the princi ples behind childre n's games and logic have scaled
up to form the fo undation of global economic systems.
I would also love to one day contribute to the space indus try—my chil dhood dr ea m was to
become a cosm onau t, and I still carry that passion with me. I want to bring value to this field,
combi ning curiosity and technical skills to solve complex challenges.
At the same time, I plan to continue my work in star tups. I find deep satisfaction in being at the
birth of something new—especially in high-unce rtai nty enviro nments. I believe this reflects one
of my favo rite traits: curiosity mixed with persi stence. For me, this is the positive force that
drive s humanity fo rward.
Thank you for conside ring my application.
Sincerely,
[name]
