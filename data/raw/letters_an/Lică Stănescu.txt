Motivation letter to [location] Summer School of Machine Learning (SMILES-2025).
My name is [name], and I recently earned a Double PhD degree in mathematics and mechanics from [compaany] and [compaany]. My doctoral research with thesis title “Machine learning enhancement of micro-CT based micromechanics of composite materials” focused heavily on applying computational techniques to experimental mechanics, particularly for composite materials. Having transitioned into a Research Scientist role at [compaany], I am now dedicated to analyzing materials through micromechanics and developing multimodal models to tackle previously unsolvable problems in the field. The SMILES-2025 program, with its specific focus on generative methods and multimodal AI, resonates deeply with my current research trajectory and future aspirations.
During my PhD, I actively immersed myself in computer vision and machine learning, largely through self-study alongside my core research. This journey led to several finished projects. For instance, I explored predicting challenging mechanical properties like fracture toughness in composite materials using data from standard mechanical tests (tensile, compression, shear), building and comparing various predictive machine learning models [1]. I also developed a GAN-based encoder-decoder model for 3D inpainting and synthetic generation of micro-computed tomography (CT) images of short fiber composites. This proved valuable for removing imaging defects and creating periodic representative volume elements (RVEs) crucial for accurate finite element modelling [2]. Furthermore, I adapted ESRGAN and CycleGAN architectures to develop a super-resolution model, significantly enhancing the quality of CT images from synchrotron facilities, which enabled automated analysis during in-situ tensile testing of unidirectional carbon fiber composites [3]. These efforts ultimately resulted in methodologies that improved the quality of CT-based RVEs and the accuracy of numerical mechanical property predictions.
While these experiences provided a strong foundation, I am aware that the field of machine learning moves incredibly fast. My self-directed learning has brought me far, but I recognize specific gaps in my knowledge, for example, I would like to learn more on the application of cutting-edge multimodal models and advanced generative techniques – areas central to the SMILES-2025 curriculum. My current work involves integrating diverse data types from mechanical testing and imaging, and I feel I am sometimes "staying behind" the state-of-the-art algorithms that could unlock new possibilities.
This is precisely why SMILES-2025 appeals to me so strongly. I am eager to deepen my understanding, learn directly from leading experts, and gain practical experience through hackathons. I believe this immersive ML/DL atmosphere is exactly what I need to bridge my knowledge gaps. Equally important to me is the opportunity to connect with a network of talented peers and potential collaborators from both [location] and [location] who share a similar mindset: we are even collaborating with [compaany]'s prof. [surname] [name] on the thermoplastic extrusion development project, who is also interested in ML/DL applications in the field of composites. Discussing the ML aspects of my research with others who are passionate about these techniques would be invaluable. My experience as a Teaching Assistant for the "Machine Learning for Engineering Applications" course (with instructor [name]) further solidified my desire to engage with the ML community more deeply.
Looking ahead, my ambition is to continue developing as a multidisciplinary specialist capable of leveraging advanced ML tools to address fundamental challenges in materials mechanics. I have several specific ideas where I believe the knowledge gained at SMILES would be directly applicable. One promising direction involves integrating nanoindentation data, which only captures surface mechanical response with very high precision, with volumetric data from micro-CT or FIB-SEM using deep learning to construct high-fidelity digital twins of complex materials. Another project aims to predict defect formation during metal 3D printing by building a multimodal model that fuses real-time data from the machine (laser parameters, trajectory etc.) with acoustic emission signals captured by sensitive microphones and vibrometers, correlating this with post-process defect analysis via XCCT. The goal is to be an integrated system capable of predicting potential defects during the printing process itself. Success in these areas is based on mastering sophisticated multimodal and potentially generative approaches.
I am confident that my background in mechanics combined with my practical ML experience offers a unique perspective. I am eager to contribute to the collaborative environment of SMILES-2025, learn from the diverse expertise present, and build lasting connections. The school's focus, intensive format, and emphasis on international collaboration represent an ideal opportunity for me to accelerate my research, enhance my skill set, and contribute more effectively to the intersection of materials science and artificial intelligence.
Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of participating in SMILES-2025 and hope to have the opportunity to learn and collaborate with you this summer.
