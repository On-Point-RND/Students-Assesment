Motivation letter
I tried to think of many ways to start this letter. Childhood memories? Sports achievements? My love for dancing and drawing? But none of them felt right—none of them captured that special spark that makes my story unique. Then, by chance, I looked at the mirror on my desk and realized: the answer had been with me all along. Inside me. In my name. [name]—not just a beautiful name, but the essence of who I am. In Latin, it means "victory." Not the easy kind, but the kind earned through doubt, setbacks, and hard work. A series of challenges, temporary defeats, but inevitable triumph in the end.
In school, I was always torn between different subjects. During my school years, I managed to become a prize-winner and win Olympiads in chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics and even literature. My teachers would say, "You're talented at everything," but to me, it felt like a curse. I was good at many things but not truly great at any of them.
When it was time to choose a career, I was lost. How could I pick just one thing when everything interested me? I applied to study programming almost at random—just because it seemed practical. But even after getting accepted, the doubts didn’t go away. 
When my whole family tried to convince me to stay in my hometown, I truly felt the weight of adult decisions for the first time. "Why do you need [location]? You have everything here," my mom would say, while I packed my bags, unable to explain this unstoppable need to prove I could do more.
The first months in the capital felt like a cruel joke on my ambitions—boring lectures, constant conflicts with roommates in the dorm, and worst of all, the nagging thought that maybe my family had been right. I watched my classmates, who had been coding since school and dreamed of working in IT, and I felt like an outsider. They spoke the language of algorithms, which I still had to learn. And me? I still wasn’t sure I even wanted to learn it.
Months passed, and I slowly started to adjust. I became the group leader and student representative, joined the university soccer team, balanced tutoring with my studies—and by the end of the first semester, I earned a scholarship for high achievers. For the first time, I thought, "Maybe I really am supposed to be here? Maybe I do deserve this?". But the doubts never fully left.
Then, one day, a friend suggested enter a competition where we had to solve a problem using AI. I knew almost nothing about it, but I was wildly curious. I accepted the challenge.
For a few months I lived in a continuous loop of self-study: university and soccer practice during the day, machine learning courses at night. When we took first place in the qualifying round with a perfect score, something inside me clicked. I knew—we had to win. I had to prove to myself that this wasn’t just a passing interest, but the passion I’d been searching for all along.
I won’t describe the finals—how the judges paused for those five endless seconds before announcing the winners, how I cried on stage when they handed us the trophy and a check for half a million rubles. But the most important thing? In that moment, I suddenly understood: This is it.  Standing there, holding that trophy, I felt it—this was mine. The field I’d lose sleep for. The passion that made my heart race. And not once did I think the judges had made a mistake.
That victory wasn’t just an achievement—it was a turning point. I finally realized that my versatility wasn’t a weakness, but a unique strength. The physicist in me sees hidden patterns, the linguist helps me articulate ideas, and the chemist finds unexpected connections. I’m no longer the "superfluous man" of classic literature—I’ve finally found the field where all facets of my thinking work together, creating a complete picture of understanding.
This camp isn't just another line on my resume. It's a challenge I accept with all my heart. I know it will be hard. I know I'll need to give not 100% of me, but 120% to be among the best (my experience at [compaany] camp last summer proved that). But this is how real skills are born - through difficult tasks, sleepless nights working on projects, and passionate discussions.
I'm excited that during these two weeks we won't just learn - we'll create real projects evaluated by brilliant experts. But most of all, I’m waiting for the moment after the final presentation when I’ll realize—Yes, it was hard, but I did it.  When I can tell myself once again: You did it, [name]. That thrill, that "I made it" feeling, will fuel my next steps: diving deeper into neural networks, researching computer vision, landing my first major internships.
To me, [name] isn’t just a name. It’s a state of constant growth, where after every triumph, you say, "This is only the beginning." And I’m ready to make this camp that beginning—the start of a new, more confident, more knowledgeable, braver version of myself. A version that isn’t afraid of challenges because she knows: behind every difficulty is another chance to prove—Yes, I am worthy of my name.
I'm ready. Ready to learn, make mistakes, try again, and in the end - win. As a true [name] should.
