Dear Esteemed Committee,
My name is [name], and I am a first-year master's student at [compaany] in the Chemical Biology and Chemistry program, specializing in "Chemistry and Artificial Intelligence." I am keen to participate in SMILES with my project titled "A Selective Generative Model for the Design of Small Organic Molecules." My research focuses on extending reinforcement learning models for small molecule generation by incorporating selective docking and integrating DynamicBind as one of the scoring functions, which could enhance drug molecule design by more accurately assessing ligand-proteiin affinity.
I am particularly interested in SMILES due to the opportunity to deeply explore generative machine learning, which I actively apply in my research. Docking methods currently used in generative models have limitations: they either insufficiently estimate binding energy, inaccurately predict ligand positioning within binding pockets, or fail to account for protein conformaational changes upon ligand interaction. Therefore, I am highly attracted to the prospect of networking with faculty and program participants, which will provide valuable insights for my project. Additionally, I look forward to contributing to the SMILES community as a volunteer.
I consider myself a suitable candidate for this schooL because of my experience working with generative models, detailed in my CV. Notably, my roles in projects and hackathons include ideation, team organization, developing reward functions for generative models, domain expertise, and preparing databases for training. In the future, I plan to pursue doctoral studies, linking my dissertation to the design of small molecules as biologically active substances through generative models.
I believe my experience and personal interest make me a strong candidate for the SMILES schooL with my project on developing a generative model for small molecule design, where I aim to contribute to the advancement of generative models for drug-like organic compounds. Thank you for considering my application, and I hope for a positive response.
Sincerely,
[name]
