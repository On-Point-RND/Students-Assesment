Motivational Letter

Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to submiit my application for the Summer SchooL of Machine Learning. Al-
though I didn’t have the opportunity to participate before, the schooL has always captured my
attention. I’d be thrilled to be part of this new step, international level and contribute to its
environment. I’m particularly looking fo rwward to lectures by [name] — his work on
generative models and optimal transport had a real influence on my own research. Some of his
ideas feel directly applicable to what I’m doing now, and I believe that attending his sessions
couldgivemeclarityanddirectionIotherwisewouldn’tget. Anoothertopicthatdeeplyinterests
me is topologicaL data analysis. Although I haven’t yet had the opportunity to explore it in my
research, I see it as a powerful tool for studying the geometry of latent spaces from a different
perspective. I was excited to see that the schooL will feature lectures by [name].
Duringmymaster’sandnowinmyPhDstudies,myrecentlineofworkhasfocusedontopics
such as generative modeling, optimal transport. My academic journey has been driven by the
interplay between information theory, geometry, and probability. Besides coding experience, I
have a strong theoreticaL foundation, supported by my mathematical research conducted during
a visit to the [compaany] institute, as well as my consistent participation with advanced courses,
including lectures from the Independent University of [location]. I’ve also been fortunate to
contribute to several research projects, some of which were accepted to A* conferences.
In Generative inpainting of incomplete eucLidian distance matrices of trajecto-
ries generated by a fractional brownian motion, accepted to Scientific Reports [3], we
addressed the challenging problem of imputing incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of frac-
tional Brownian motion (fBm). We found that diffusion models are well suited to this task,
robustly recovering long-range memory features even under high missingness. My role in this
project was to implement inpainting diffusion methods such as DDNM, DDRM, RePaint, con-
ducting all experiments and computing metrics.
Our work Color transfer with modulated flows, accepted to AAAI [1], introduced
a rectified flow-based approach for transferring color styles between images. Using optimal
transport and invertible transformations in RGB space, we trained a model that can generalize
color mappings to unseen image pairs, enabling high-resolution transfer without additional fine-
tuning. This work also introduced a novel embedding that isolates stylistic information, which
can be used in applications in style-aware retrieval and content filtering. My main contribution
to this project was the development of baselines’ pipelines, generating results, and computing
evaluation metrics.
InColor conditional generation with sliced wasserstei n distance,acceptedtoCVPR
[2], we developed a novel, training-free method that modifies the diffusion sampling process by
1
incorporating the Sliced Wasserstei n distance between color histograms. This results in images
that are not onl y faithful to a reference palette but also semantically coherent with the textual
input—addre ssing a major limitation of pr evious color transfer methods. My main role here
was implementing the base version of the code, exploring different Sliced Wasserstei n metrics,
and contributing theoreticaL proofs.
In a recent theoreticaL work, Hessian Geometry of Latent Space in Generative Mod-
els, submitted to ICML, we explored the geometry of generative latent spaces. We proposed a
general method for recovering the metric in implicit models and revealed a latent-space analog
of phase transitions in diffusion models. Our analysis uncovere d regions where interpolation
fails due to local geometrical instabilities, characterized by divergent Lipschitz constants. At
this project I conducted all experiments and helped to develop theory.
Together, these projects reflect my broader research interest: to understand and use the
geometrical and probabilistic structure of generative models. Looking ahead, I plan to continue
in research. I see myself staying close to the intersection of generative models and scienti fic
applications— for example on applying these insights to quantum machine learning.

I am confident that my experience and motivation will allow me to contribute to the schooL.
Thank you for considering my application.
