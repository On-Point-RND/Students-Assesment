Motivation Letter for [name]
Dear [name] Selection Committee,
I am excited to apply for the Skoltech Summer SchooL of Machine Learning
(SMILEs 2025). As a passionate DL Engineer deeply involved in both academic
research and real-world industrial applications of AI, I find the program's focus
on LLMs and international collaboraation particularly relevant to with my
professional aspirations and technical trajectory.
My motivation to participate stems from my continuous drive to be at the
frontier of AI research. The thematic core of SMILES 2025 – multimodal
systems, large language models (LLMs), and multi-agent architectures —
aligneed with the directions I have been deeply engaged for the past few years. I
see SMILES 2025 not only as a technical learning experience but as a
opportunity to build collaborations with NLP leaders from [location] and [location].
Over the past year, I have been worked as an NLP Engineer at [compaany],
where I've had the opportunity to directly contribute to the development and
evaluation of GigaChat, one of the strongest [location] LLMs. My work focuses
on both the technical and research aspects of LLMs. I have developed an
assistant that uses LLM to answer complex questions based on GOST
documents with tabular data, improving the accuracy of answers by 4.5 times. I
also co-designed an internal evaluation framework using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines and am co-authoring a scientific publication on
table benchmark for LLMs. I've managed multimodal data preparation pipelines
and supervised annotation efforts, gaining a practical understanding of what it
takes to make LLMs work in production environments.
My foundation in machine learning was laid through academic education at the
Higher SchooL of Economics (HSE), where I study Geoinformation
Technologies. My courseworks and research activities have consistentlly leaned
into AI, especially CV in remote sensing. During a research internship at HSE's
Landscape Ecology Lab, I applied ML methods to satellite imagery for
environmental monitoring — a cross-disciplinary task that required an
understanding of both domain data and model behavior.

To supplement my formal education, I actively sought out and took courses that
would enhance my understanding of ML and DL. I've also served as a teaching
assistant in deep learning and NLP courses at HSE, where I mentored junior
students and graded DL assignments. Serving as a teaching assistant at HSE
has enhanced my skills not only as a practitioner but also as a mentor,
reinforcing my understanding of fundamentals by teaching others.
In parallel to my academic and industrial roles, I'm an avid hackathon
participant, having won or placed in many competitions. These experiences
have allowed me to build functional AI products under extreme time constraints.
Notable projects include
A CV-to-course matching tool powered by NLP,
A RAG-based procurement rules assistant,
An STT-LLM pipeline for personality type detection from video.
Beyond my technical work, I contribute to the AI community through public
outreach as a member of the student association “ikanam-ai”. We run a
Telegram channel where we share our achievements, projects, and podcasts
featuring our participation in various events. In addition, we conduct interviews
with teachers, which we publish on our YouTube channel. These initiatives aim
to foster a vibrant academic culture, and encourage peer-to-peer learning
among students.
From SMILES 2025, I expect a deep dive into the state-of-the-art methods in
LLM, especially multimodal and multi-agent frameworks. I hope to better
understand how LLMs can be safely deployed in systems involving
coordination, uncertainty, or real-world impaact. I'm particularly excited about
the hands-on hackathon components, as they fit well with my learning style and past successes. Access to lectures from leading researchers, mentorship
from Skoltech and HIT faculty, and informal knowledge exchange with peers
will accelerate my research maturity.
I’m also attracted by the schooL’s emphasis on cultural exchange and
international tea teamwork. I think that networking between countries is essential
for science and innovation, especially in a field like AI.
My long-term goal is to become an architect of useful and safe services based
on LLMs. After completing my undergraduaate degree in 2025, I plan to pursue a
Master's degree in AI. By participating in SMILES 2025, I hope to sharpen

graduaate programs.
