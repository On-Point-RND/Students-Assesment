To [compaany] 2025 Summer School Organizers April 20, 2025
Dear Admissions Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I’m writing to express my interest in participating in your summer
school in machine learning. I see this as an important oppopportunity to cconnect with a
research-focused community, and to take a concrete step toward contributing meaningfully to the
field.
I recently completed a Master’s degree in Data Science at the [compaany] ,
following a Bachelor’s in Economics. During my studies, I focused on learning about machine
learning independently, and actively participated in projects and competitions. For my Master’s
thesis, I researched preference optiimization in diffusion models — something that sparked a strong
interest in generative CV and deep generative models in general. After graduaation, I’ve been
working in an applied ML engineering role at [compaany]— while it’s been valuable experience, I’ve found it
diffiicult to continue pursuing ML research, the kind of exploratory, research-focused work that
motivates me.
I’m particularly excited by the opportuntity to engage with others who care about developing ideas
and advancing the field. I’m ready to contribute with curiosity, drive, and knowlledge, and I see this
program as a step toward transitioning into research. I hope it will help me build connections that
are hard to find when working independently.
Thank you for consideering my application. I’m excited about the posssibility of joining this program
and would bring my full attention and energy to it.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
