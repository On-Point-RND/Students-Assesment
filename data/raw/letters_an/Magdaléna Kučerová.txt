Dear SMILES Summer School Admissions Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am a second-year physics student at [compaany]. I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in your summer school on machine learning in [location]. This is a unique opportunity for me to deepen my expertise in ML, explore international approaches to problem-solving, and apply these skills to interdisciplinary projects bridging physics, geoscience, and data analysis.
My Experience in ML and Research
At the Geothermiics and Oil Reservoir Laboratory of [compaany], I contributed to a project predicting rock permeability using ML algorithms (CatBoost, Random Forest, linear regression). My comparison of physical models with ML methods yielded a significant improvement in accuracy (R²=0.89, 15–20% higher than empirical approaches). This experience highlighted ML’s potential for tasks where analytical solutions fall short.
Technical Skills:
• Programming: Python (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib), basics of C++, SQL.
• Numerical Methods: Solving differential equations, optimization, spatial data analysis.
• Data Processing: Rock property prediction, cross-validation, metric interpretation.
• Presentations: Delivered a talk at the "Lo[compaany]-2024" conference.
Why SMILES?
1. Deep Learning: I aim to master CNN and Transformer arcitectures for core sample image analysis (e.g., fracture segmentation).
2. Global Perspective: Learning in [location] will expose me to cutting-edgе practices and broaden my network.
3. Applied Focus: I am keen to develop hybrid models combining physics-based equations and ML for reservoir forecasting.
My Goals:
1. Build a CNN-based model for automated core analysis.
2. Join hackatho[compaany]s (e.g., GPN INTELLIGENCE CUP) to tackle real-world challenges.
3. Launch an interdisciplinary project merging physics and ML.
Soft skills:
• Tea[compaany]work: Collabora[compaany]ted with geologists and programmers, adapti[compaany]ng terminology across fields.
• Communication: Presented research to expert panels and at conferences.
Conclusion
SMILES will be a springboard for transiti[compaany]oning from classical ML to advanced techniques. My physics background and data analysis skills will allow me to contribute meaningfully to the school’s projects. I would welcome the chance to discuss my experience further.
Sincerely,
