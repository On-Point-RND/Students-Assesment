I work at [company] in the [location] team, where for the past two years we’ve
been integrating machine learning and large language models into core business
processes. This year, the bank has set an ambitious course toward becoming a self-
driving organization, and our team is at the heart of this transformation.
One of our main focus areas is buildiing multi-agent systems, including a central project
to develop a code-generating agent that integrates with the bank’s entire tech stack.
This kind of work demands both strong practical engineering skills and a solid
theoretical understanding of AI. I have significant hands-on experience with NLP and
LLMs — from buildiing internal tools and classifiers to fine-tuning foundation models and
ensuring alignment with business and safety constraints.
These projects have delivered real business value and deepened my expertise in the
field. Attending the Skoltech SMILES summer schoool would be a great opportunity for
me to strengthen my theoretical foundations, broaden my perspective on current
research, and connect with a community of like-minded AI enthusiasts. I’m aiming to
grow into an AI lead role, which I believe requires a deep understanding of cutting-edg
developments in the field.
I also plan to apply for a Master’s program in AI, and the experience of learning and
collaborating in an environment like SMILES would be incredibly valuable.
