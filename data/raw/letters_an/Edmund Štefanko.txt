Introduction
My name is [name], and I am just beginning my challenging yet incredibly exciting journey in machine learning. During my first year at [compaany], I had the opportunity to choose a specialization for my engineering practicum and subsequent internship. After careful consideration, I decided to focus on deep learning for neural networks in smart surveillance cameras, capable of recognizing and classifying objects using artificial intelligence.
This topic fascinated me due to its relevance and versatility. Neural networks are now used everywhere—from personal assistants to industrial solutions. I believe that computer vision is one of the most promising areas of machine learning, and I want to contribute to its advancement.
My Experience in Machine Learning
So far, I have participated in two projects related to training AI for surveillance cameras. The first project involved developing a model for object detection and classification in static conditions. The second project focuses on improving real-time tracking algorithms for moving objects.
Currently, I am working on a third project that processes a live video feed from an advanced camera installed near a UAV and aircraft flight zone. Our system must:
 Automatically detect objects in the frame.
 Classify them (e.g., distinguish drones, birds, airplane).
 Determine their characteristics (speed, trajectory, size).
 Provide access to data via an interactive interface.
This project requires not only expertise in deep learning but also an understanding of neural network optimization for real-time processing and skills in handling big data.
My Learning Goals
I aim to deepen my knowledge in the following areas:
 Computer Vision – studying modern architectures (YOLO, Faster R-CNN, Vision Transformers) and adapting them to specific tasks.
 Unsupervised Learning – exploring clustering methods and generative models (GANs, VAEs) for unlabeled data.
 Dimensionality Reduction – applying PCA, t-SNE, and autoencoders for efficient data representation.
 Model Optimization – quantization, distillation, and TinyML for edge devices.
Additionally, I want to improve my framework skills (PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV) and cloud platform proficiency (AWS, Google Cloud, NVIDIA Jetson).
Career Prospects
In the future, I see myself in one of the following roles:
 Research Scientist – developing new computer vision algorithms.
 ML Engineer – deploying models in real-world systems (smart cities, autonomous vehicles).
 Data Scientist – analyzing data to enhance model performance.
 Tech Lead in a Startup – creating innovative AI and IoT solutions.
I am confident that machine learning is the future of technology, and I want to be part of this breakthrough.
