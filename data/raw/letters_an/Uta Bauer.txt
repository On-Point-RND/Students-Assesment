My primary research interest revolves around event sequences,
particularly irregular tabular time series data. My ambition is to advance
the field by learning robust representations of such sequences through
self-supervised learning techniques and leveraging the powerful
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the
performance and interpretability of these representations. By attending
SMILE 2025, I aim to deepen my knowledge, gain novel perspectives,
and practically apply state-of-the-art methods within this research
domain.
I am currently employed as a researcher at the [compaany], the R&D
center of [compaany]. My role specifically focuses on developing and
applying multimodal machine learning methods and fusion algorithms for
processing time-ordered financial data. At [compaany], my projects
involve extensive experimentation with sequential banking data (event
sequences), aiming to create predictive and analytical models that
significantly impact financial decision-making processes. Through this
work, I have developed substantial expertise in handling complex
multimodal data structures, designing neural network architectures
tailored for sequence analysis, and implementing efficient algorithms that
integrate different modalities, such as transactional data, clickstream and
dialogues.
Additionally, my current master's thesis, titled "Learning Enhanced Event
Sequence Representation via Textual Augmentation," focuses on
methods for aligning representations of raw transactional data with their
textual descriptions generated by LLMs. This research aims to leverage
the semantic richness provided by LLM-generated text to improve the
interpretability and predictive capabilities of transaction-based models.
My decision to apply for SMILES 2025 is driven by three distinct
objectives: communication, scientific advancement, and cultural
exploration.
From a communicative standpoint, I am eager to engage actively with
fellow researchers from diverse scientific backgrounds. Interdisciplinary
collaboration is invaluable for expanding research boundaries, refining
ideas, and catalyzing innovation. The environment at SMILES, with its
vibrant community of passionate young scientists, presents a unique
opportunity for knowledge exchange and networking, helping me forge
lasting professional relationships and enriching my understanding
beyond my immediate research scope.
Scientifically, SMILES 2025 offers an exceptional platform to explore the
integration of LLMs into domains traditionally less explored by NLP
techniques, particularly event sequences and irregular time series. The
school's structured projects and interactive workshops are perfectly
aligned with my research trajectory. I aim to utilize this unique
environment to conceptualize and implement a focused project on
applying advanced LLM methodologies to enhance event sequence
representation and predictive modeling. This endeavor would not only
broaden my methodological toolkit but also potentially result in
publishable contributions, benefiting the broader scientific community.
Culturally, attending the summer school in [location] is personally
significant. [Location]'s distinctive blend of Russian historical heritage and
vibrant Chinese culture makes it an intriguing destination. Experiencing
firsthand the fusion of these diverse cultural influences is something I
deeply look forward to, providing not only a refreshing personal
experience but also broadening my cultural horizons. Understanding
different cultures profoundly contributes to one's capacity for creative
and innovative thought, particularly in research settings.
Regarding my future career plans, I am particularly interested in
exploring the application of LLMs and self-supervised learning
techniques to financial market data, especially in the context of
multimodal learning and fusion algorithms. One compelling area is
extracting multimodal features from [location] order book data
(prices) combined with sentiment analysis derived from tweets or other
textual sources indirectly influencing market dynamics. This
interdisciplinary approach could yield valuable predictive insights and
potentially advance our understanding of financial market behaviors,
aligning perfectly with my long-term professional aspirations.
