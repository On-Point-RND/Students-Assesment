Right now, I’m part of an industrial ML team where we focus on unsupervised learning to build health indices for industrial machinery. We work with deep learning models in PyTorch, combiining autoencoders, transformers, and physics-inspired and causal graph-based appoaches. Our main goal is to detect early signs of degradaation in multivariate time series — often in the absence of labeled data.
I’m also interested in data generation techniques, as failure cases are rare in real-world systems. At universiity, I took courses on autonomous agents and large languaage models. As part of the LLM course, I built a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. Since these topics will also be covered in the schoool program, I’m especially looking forward to deepening my experience in these areas.
It would also be great to learn more about multimodal models and AI safety — both of which are becoming increasingly important and are aligneed with my interests.
Looking ahead, I plan to continue doing research — ideally at [compaany] — and apply advanced ML methods to meaningful scientific and industrial problems. I do my best to keep up with the latest tools and ideas in deep learning, and I see this schoool as a great opportunity to refresh and deepen my knowledge, learn from the community, and connect with others pushing the field forward.
Thanks a lot for reading!
