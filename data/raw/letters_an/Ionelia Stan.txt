Motivation Letter
Dear Organizers of the [compaany] Annual Summer SchooL on Machine
Learning (SMILES),
My name is [name] and I am writing to express my strong
interest in participating in SMILES 2025. I am currently a PhD student at
the [compaany] in the Department
of Applied Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence. The research is in the
area of intelligent driving using neural networks.
Last year, I had the privilege of attending SMILES-2024, and it was a
rewarding experience. The intensive sessions on generative AI, large-scale
language modelling, and other deep learning greatly broadened my
technical horizons. In addition, mentorship from industry experts and the
opportunity to network with peers from diverse backgrounds inspired me
to continuously refiine my research methods and explore interdisciplinary
applications of AI.
My academic journey has focused on bridging machine learning with
intelligent transportation systems. Key accomplishments include:

DADA-2000 Dataset: I co-deveveloped this large-scale driver
•
attention prediction dataset , which addresses critical challenges in
autonomous driving under emergency scenarios.
Building on my hands-on experience with generative AI and
collaborative projects gained at SMILES-2024, my focus at SMILES-2025
is threefold. Firstlly, I aim to deepen my work on generative modelling as
well as multimodal generative modelling, in particular the alignment
between text-to-scene, and to improve the performance of the methods
studied. Second, I plan to take advantage of my participation in the
hackathon to improve my personal expertise by learning from each other
and from other scholars. Finally, having participated in several
collaborative exchanges between Chinese and Russian institutions as a
teaching assistant at the schooL, I am eager to contribute to this international
collaboration at SMILES.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to
contribute to and learn from the SMILES-2025 community. Please feel free
to contact me for any additional details.
Sincerely,
[name]
