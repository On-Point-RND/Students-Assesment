Dear Organizers,
I am writing to express my enthusiasm for attending the SMILES school.
Currently, I am a researcher at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics at [location]. Recently, I defended the Ph.D. thesis in the approximation theory under the guidance of Professor [surname]. I am honored to have been recognized as one of the three Laureates of the Sirius Mathematical Centre Prize for Ph.D. students in [location] (2024). My research has resulted in 12 publications in high-impact journals, including 5 without coauthors.
To complement my solid foundation in mathematics, I pursued a two-year program in data science, where I developed a strong understanding of machine learning principles. In addition, I have engaged in several short-term projects and research internships focused on deep learning. Notably, at [company], my team utilized inverse differential rendering techniques to create realistic 3D assets from real-world imagery. My efforts contributed to optimizing mesh quality.
Having participated in SMILES-2023, I found the experience valuable. I appreciated the diverse range of topics, the engaging and accessible lectures, the project-oriented approach, and the vibrant community. My research was awarded the “Best Poster”. I have utilized the materials from the school in my subsequent work. I believe that attending SMILES again would further enrich my knowledge and research capabilities.
After Ph.D. completion, I am eager to delve into new challenges and expand my understanding of contemporary topics. Participating in the SMILES school presents an excellent opportunity to achieve this. Additionally, I am currently involved in a collaborative project focused on ECG processing using Distributed Learning, and the knowledge gained at SMILES could benefit this project.
Many cutting-edge methods in neural networks are rooted in mathematical concepts, such as optimal transport, barycenters, statistics, optimization, etc.
This mutual dependency highlights the importance of collaboration between mathematicians and machine learning engineers. Some of these connections are discussed on the seminar “Mathematical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence” organized by the Head of my Laboratory Prof. [surname], where several SMILES lecturers were presented. I would greatly appreciate the chance to listen to more of their lectures.
Thank you for considering my application.
Warm regards,
