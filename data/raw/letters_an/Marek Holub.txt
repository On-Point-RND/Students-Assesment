To whom it may concern,
I am writing to express my interest in the [compaany] Summer School of Machine Learning, as machine learning has deeply connected with my current research.
My scientific journey began at the intersection of biophysics and software development, where I designed computational tools for medical devices grounded in physical principles. This experience taught me how theoretical insights can translate into real-world devices--a theme that has guided my career ever since.
During my master's studies, I was invited to conduct research in theoretical photonics. My commitment to work on a theoretical physics project was in view of the fact that abstract mathematical ideas can modify the way we observe the real world, which captivated my interest. Here, I discovered the captivating realm of topological photonics, where light can be controlled with unprecedented precision. This work has flourished through international collaborations, including partnerships with the [location] National University. Together, weâ€™ve published our findings in high-impact journals such as Nature Communications and Physical Review Letters.
In 2022, I participated in the summer school on machine learning at [location] University, organized by [compaany]. At the time, I had just begun exploring ML and presented my first research results in a poster session. The discussions there were incredibly valuable -- they not only refined my initial ideas but also inspired me to advance the work further. This research was published in Nanophotonics (Q1, IF=7.4), and we are further developing this approach.
During the program, our team worked on PINNs for solving wave equations. This project introduced me to the power of hybrid approaches that combine ML with physical modeling. Motivated by this experience, I shifted my focus to studying partial differential equations in photonic systems and developed data-driven methods for discovering PDEs that govern light propagation in complex nonlinear photonic lattices[ [surname],etal.arXiv:2411.11556(2024)]--an area with high potential for both fundamental aspects and practical applications.
ML methods are now flourishing in photonics, particularly in areas like inverse design. For example, generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing photonic structures. During this school, I aim to deepen my understanding of these techniques and apply them to our collaborative research with the Institute of Physics of MicrorustructuresRAS, where we conduct real-world experiments. I look forward to gaining hands-on experience and learning about other cutting-edge ML approaches that can further advance my work in physics.
I view this program in [location] as an invaluable opportunity to engage with international students, exchange cultural perspectives, and learn diverse approaches to research. Such interactions are essential for building meaningful collaborations at the intersection of physics and artificial intelligence -- a field where global cooperation drives innovation.
The impact of studying ML at the school on me as a young researcher would be significant which is going to increase my chances of success in my scientific career. It is an opportunity I would love to dedicate myself to wholeheartedly, both academically and through volunteer initiatives. My prior experience organizing local conferences has equipped me with valuable skills for coordinating academic and social activities, which I would gladly contribute to the program. Considering my strong academic background and my desire to enrich my knowledge in advanced AI techniques, I am confident I would make meaningful contributions to the program.
Thank you for considering my application.
Yours sincerely,
