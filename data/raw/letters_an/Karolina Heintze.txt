Dear Members of the SMILES Summer School Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my genuine interest in participating in the Skoltech Summer School
of Machine Learning (SMILE) 2025. Currently, I am a fourth-year PhD student at [location] Electrotechnical University "LETI", specializing in Computer Science and
Engineering. My research is closely connected with the application of artificial intelligence
methods and big data analysis. In my dissertation work, I focus on modeling induction hardening
processes for steel components, utilizing machine learning algorithms for data analysis and
processing. This project aims to develop comprehensive numerical models that can optimize the
design of hardening equipment, improve the quality of final products, and deepen our
understanding of heat treatment processes for steels and alloys.
My proficiency in both English and French allows me to collaborate effectively with
international colleagues and contribute productively to diverse teams.
By applying to SMILES, I am sincerely motivated to expand my technical toolkit and
immerse myself more deeply in the world of data analysis and machine learning. My experience
as an engineer-developer, combined with my research in mathematical optimization methods, has
made me keenly aware of the importance of mastering data analysis and machine learning tools in
todayâ€™s world.
I look forward to SMILES not only as an opportunity to acquire new technical skills, but
also as a chance to develop critical thinking and data analysis abilities. I am confident that these
skills will be invaluable both in my current research and in future projects.
Having reviewed the program, I appreciate its balance between theory and practice. I am
particularly interested in the focus on multimodal approaches and self-supervised learning
methods. The prospect of engaging with leading experts and interacting with fellow participants
is especially appealing, as I believe this will provide valuable insights into current trends in machine learning.
Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that participating in the Summer
School will be an important step in my professional development.
Sincerely, [name] [surname]
