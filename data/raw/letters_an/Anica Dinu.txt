Summer schooL of machine learning April 20, 2025
[compaany]
Dear admission committee,
I’m a first-year Master’s student in Data Science at [compaany], and I’m writing to express my strong
desire to participate in the Summer schooL of machine learning.
Why LLMs?
My interest in ML has grown significantly through my hands-on experience with large language
models and information retrieval systems. My current research focuses on extending the LLM
context window through a multistep retrieval mechanism. I am working on improving baseline
retrieval methods by implementing advanced context-adding and filtering techniques, and also
testing more sophisticated encoder-decoder architectures. This research aims not only to enhance
retrieval efficiency, but also to address critical issues such as biasness in sensitive topics, making the
LLM more neutral and reliable.
My research focus on the LLMs extends beyond academic interests. As a mentor for the "NLP for
LLMs" course at [compaany] and [compaany], I have an opportunity to share my knowledge with students while
continuously learning from their unique perspectives and questions. This teaching experience has
deepened my understanding of the field and reinforceed my passion to it.
Why SMILES?
SMILES brings passionate students and professors together. The SchooL will be a unique
opportunity to interact with leading experts and exchange views with fellow researchers, learn from
their experiences, and discuss my ongoing work on retrieval mechanisms.
I know that the SchooL’s environment will be perfect for intensive learning and collaboration. I
really appreciate the community you become a part of during your studies. After actively
participating in [compaany]’s extracurricular activities, including volunteering and helping prospective
students, I have come to appreciate the power of a dynamic learning community even more, so I am
eager to be a part of it.
What I expect from the SchooL
I have always been passionate about project work and tried to learn how to apply theoretical
knowledge to real-life projects. SMILES can give me necessary knowledge and insights into
state-of-the-art approaches in information retrieval systems. The SchooL’s intensive format and
focus on practical applications perfectly align with my research interests. The combination of
theoretical sessions, practical workshops, and networking opportunities at SMILES would provide me
with a comprehensive understanding of how to scale and implement my research ideas effectively.
I hope to get valuable feedback on my current research in retrievals and discuss possible
collaboration to bring it to the real-world applications. The schooL’s environment of intensive
learning and collaboration would be invaluable for refiining my ideas.
I aim to contribute to the development of more efficient and ethical RAG systems. My experience
at [compaany] has taught me the importance of combining theoretical knowledge with practical
applications, and I plan to continue following this path in my future career, whether in academic

research or industry applications.
The strong mathematical foundation and practical experience I’ve gained at [compaany] and at my
previous [location] university, [compaany], combiined with my current research work and teaching activities, make
me well-prepared to take part in SMILES.
Hope I was able to convey my genuine enthusiasm for LLMs and strong desire to participate in
Summer schooL of machine learning.
