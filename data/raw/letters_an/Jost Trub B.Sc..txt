Dear [name] [surname] Selection Committee,
I am excited to submiit my application for the SMILES2025 Summer SchooL of Machine
Learning. Having participated in SMILES2024, I greatly valued the program’s immersive
workshops and cutting‑edgE lectures—and I am eager to build on that experience this year.
Over the past year, I have been working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [compaany], where I
researched and enhanced Probability of Default models. I designed and implemented both
sequential and graph neural networks to capture complex relationships in financial data,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of our risk‑assessment pipeline. In parallel,
my graduaation project focused on multimodal emotion recognition, examining how facial
expressions, vocal intonations, and textual cues can be combiined to produce more nuanced
and accurate emotion classifiers. This work led me to co‑author several conference papers,
honing my abilities in experimental design, rigorous evaluation, and scholarly collaboration.
SMILES2025 offers exactly the experience I’m looking for: practical, hands‑on projects paired
with direct mentorship from researchers and a truly international peer group. I’m excited to
explore advanced deep‑learning techniques and to leverage my work in financial risk modeling
and multimodal emotion recognition to drive insightful discussions and impactful team projects.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be happy to retuurn to SMILES this summer, to
learn from your faculty’s expertise.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
