Statement of Purpose
My name is [name], and I am a final-year student at [location].
Education and Teaching
I graduated with a Bachelor's degree from [location] in 2023, from a joint program of [location] and [compaany] [compaany]. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in the same department. This program is at the intersection of mathematics and computer science. During my studies at [location] and 3.5 years at [compaany] [compaany], I have gained both fundamental knowledge in mathematical analysis, linear algebra, probability theory, and statistics, as well as applied skills related to machine learning and deep learning. The most interesting scientific fields for me are probability theory and statistics, which I have been teaching at [location] for 2 years, with my teaching skills being highly appreciated by students. In machine learning, I am interested in generative models, computer vision models, and large language models. During my time at [location], I attended basic machine learning courses, and at the Data Analysis Department, I was able to gain advanced knowledge and skills in courses such as NLP, CV and Deep CV, Generative Models, and Reinforcement Learning. I am proficient in modern frameworks.
Work Experience
During my student years, I worked for a year and a half as an Analyst-Developer at [compaany] [compaany], applying my knowledge in statistics and probability theory for data collection and improving automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. However, in this position, I was lacking opportunities to apply machine learning and deep learning knowledge, so after some time, I took a break from work and returned six months later to the [compaany] International Search team as an ML Developer. Currently, I train ranking models for a search engine in [location] and other countries. Essentially, I work with training gradient boosting models, BERTs, and apply standard practices for model distillation to improve quality. For the past six months, I've been working on prompt engineering for annotations and creating a unified ranking model. Overall, I like my position, but I miss the opportunity to engage in research and develop something fundamentally new.
Science and research
For this reason, I am conducting research at the intersection of statistics and generative models. I am currently undergoing a two-month internship at [location]. Over the course of two months, I prepared a scientific paper on using Neural-Bayes estimators for parameter evaluation of models. What attracts me to my research field is that I can use a powerful mathematical foundation to prove complex and necessary statements about the properties of models, then apply experience in machine learning to train auxiliary estimations. Soon my internship will end, I plan to defend my Master's thesis and publish an article.
My Goals and Expectations from the Internship
I plan to pursue a PhD abroad, as the Russian candidate's degree is not recognized by foreign companies. I am already finishing my internship at [location], and currently, I would like to get acquainted with the [location] Institute of Technology and, in general, with education in [location]. My colleagues have already visited [location] and spoke well of the universities in this country. If the research and projects I will engage with during the two-week school are interesting and allow me to grow as a researcher and developer, I will apply for a PhD at this university. I would also really like to meet strong students, professors, and researchers in the field of machine learning, exchange experiences, and work on projects. And of course, I would love to immerse myself in [location] culture as much as possible in 2 weeks. I am open to new knowledge, new projects, new research, and new experiences.
I hope that the experience of being at the [location] Institute of Technology will not only become a line in my resume but also a bright and useful chapter of my life.
