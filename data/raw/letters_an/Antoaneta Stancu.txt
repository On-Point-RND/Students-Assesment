I’m [name] [surname], a lecturer at [compaany], and I’m super excited about your summer schoo l. I’ve been tinkering with making big ML models run faster—messing with CUDA graphs, squeezing out extra speed in PyTorch, even re‑writing bits to cut down on compute time. Right now I’m digging into that PyGraph paper on compiler support for CUDA Graphs in PyTorch
(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/390176402_PyGraph
_Robust_Compiiler_Support_for_CUDA_Graphs_in_PyTorch), and
it really got me thinking about how we can build more
reliable, faster GPU pipelines.
Large language models are my jam. I love playing with
infrastructure twea ks—optimizing data pipelines, reducing
memory overhead, twea king kernels. Sometimes I forget to
have lu nch because I’m chasing down a few milliseconds
gain! But I also love to have conversations about ideas:
I’ve organized hacka thons, mentored students on crazy
side‑projects, and organised science club in [location] with
cycling events where we discuss about scienti fic articles
after sport.
I’m not great at writing perfectl y. I want to learn new
generative tricks, bounce ideas on multi‑agent systems, and
meet peers from [location] and [location] who also get jazzed about
code and har dware.
Also I am interesting give some lectures in Python and
calculs opti mi sation process in the Smiles 2025.
