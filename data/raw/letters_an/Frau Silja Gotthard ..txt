Motivation letter for participation in the SMILES-2025 Summer School
[name] [surname]
My name is [name], I am a 4th-year student at the [compaany], I study at the Faculty of [compaany] and work in the laboratory of machine learning in Earth Sciences. My research work is related to the use of machine learning methods and neural networks to reconstruct historical data on the relative humidity of the atmosphere above the ocean, one of the key climatic parameters.
As part of my work in the laboratory, I used machine learning models, including linear regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting (CatBoost) and a fully connected neural network (multilayer perceptron). To improve the quality of the models, I optimized hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization (Optuna).
To account for regional and seasonal variability in humidity, I have developed a method for spatial and temporal data partitioning, which made it possible to adapt models to local climatic conditions.
Additionally, I used clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering) in order to identify areas with minimal variance of meteorological parameters and further analyze them.
Special attention was paid to assessing the reliability of the models. I conducted an analysis of the uncertainty of both the target variable itself and quality metrics (in particular RMSE) using the bootstrap method. This made it possible to quantify the stability of the models and identify regions with an increased level of uncertainty.
In addition, an analysis of the spatial distribution of model errors was carried out, which made it possible to determine the causes of a decrease in the quality of moisture restoration in some regions of the world ocean.
The results of the study were presented in a scientific article, which was accepted for publication in the journal «Oceanological Research».
I also presented the results of my work at conferences on machine learning and climate science, including:
• "Russia in the United Nations Decade of Ocean Sciences. Resources and Knowledge" (November 2024)
• "The 67th All-Russian Scientific Conference of [compaany]" (April 2025)
• "Lomonosov 2025" (April 2025)
In addition to my research work, I completed professional retraining in Advanced Machine Learning Methods. As part of this program, I not only deepened my knowledge of classical machine learning algorithms, but also gained practical experience working with various neural network architectures — fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent.
My current research work in the field of machine learning for climate challenges has increased my interest in broader and more promising areas of artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in the areas studied under this program, such as generative and multimodal models, LLM and multi—agent systems. I strive to study these areas in depth and I am sure that participation in the school will allow me to gain valuable knowledge applicable both in fundamental research and in solving problems at the intersection of artificial intelligence and natural sciences.
I consider participation in SMILES-2025 as a unique opportunity to get acquainted with the work of leading researchers from [compaany], [compaany] and [compaany], take part in practical project sessions, work in an intensive research environment, and discuss ideas with experts and participants with similar interests.
For me, participation in the school is an opportunity to go beyond the already mastered applied tasks, broaden my horizons and lay the foundation for further work on more complex projects in the field of artificial intelligence. I am confident that the program will allow me to gain valuable knowledge and experience, which will become an important stage in my academic and professional growth.
Thank you for reviewing my application!
