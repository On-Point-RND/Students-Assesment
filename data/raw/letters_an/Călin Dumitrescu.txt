Dear Selection Committee,
I am excited to apply for your summer schoo lprogram. As the ML lead of a small team in the
Communication Design Department at [compaany], I create AI-driven solutions for business
challenges using Python and ML libraries like PyTorch. Although I did not study machine
learning at universi ty, my self-taught experti se and passion for the field have driven my success.
I am eager to deepen my kn owledge of large lan gua ge models, generative app roaches, and
multimodal techniques to address real-wor ld challenges. The opport unity to work with
cutting-e dg e technol ogies, participat e in hacka thons, and gain mentorship aligns perf ectly with
my goals.
Having alr eady gained experience in buildi ng star tups, I view the deve lopment of my own
AI-focused start up as a concrete goal, not just a dr eam. I am committed to making this a reality
alongside my inn ovative work at [compaany].
I look fo rward to expanding and sharing my kn owledge at SMILES-2025.
[name] [surname]
