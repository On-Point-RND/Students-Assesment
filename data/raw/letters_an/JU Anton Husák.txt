Dear SMILES Summer School Committee,
I’m excited to apply for the SMILES Summer School at [company]. In this letter, I aim to outline
my academic background, motivation for participation, and the contributions I can bring to this year’s school.
About me:
• This year I am completing my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence Technologies at [company];
• I have around 3 years of hands-on experience in computer vision and a few conference or
journal papers. In general, I work with CV for robotics and related topics;
• My current research (which is also my diploma) is related to open-vocabulary materials
recognition in images, and my contribution involves creation of custom dataset and CLIP
architecture optimization;
• I have practical experience with generative models (Diffusion Models, LLLs) through
coursework and personal projects;
• I have international research experience through [company] internship (France) and NIBS con-
ference presentation (India);
• After graduation I am planning to work in one of the industrial companies and build AI
solutions that make real-world impact.
Why I want to participate:
• I am seeking structured learning in generative AI to complement my computer vision
expertise;
• I have an interest in cross-cultural academic exchange, particularly with China’s AI
research community;
• SMILES’2024 boosted my skills and the overall AI field understanding, and I believe that
SMILES’2025 can do the same;
• It will be a great opportunity to apply my English skills in technical discussions;
• Finally, I want to have good holidays between my hard-working graduation and my new
after-graduation life.
What I will bring to the table:
• Practical experience in research and industrial projects;
• Experience in technical paper reading/writing;
• Strong programming experience (particularly in C++) and proficiency in rapid prototyping
and system optimization;
• Good collaborative skills.
Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to meet the community and my
colleagues in [location].
Best regards,
[name] [surname]
