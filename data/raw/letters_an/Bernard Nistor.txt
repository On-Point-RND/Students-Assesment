Dear [name] Committee,
I’m [name], a first-year PhD student at [compaany]'s English-language program, where I’ve
had the privilege of collaborating with peers from over a dozen [location]. I’m thrilled by the
opportunity to join SMILES 2025 in [location], as it perfectly bridges rigorous seminars on large
language models, multimodal perception, multi-agent systems, generative modeling, self- and
safe-learning, with hands-on industrial challenges.
What excites me most is working alonsgside leading international professors and industry
experts to move fast from research ideas into deployable solutions. In lab at [compaany], I guided
small team to prototype full-stac AI applications—whether refining a real-time dialogue system
for customer support or orchestrating containerized simulations for molecular design. These
experiences taught me to balance innovatiive experimentaation with production constraints
such as latency, scalability, and safety.
At [compaany], I co-authored a paper on gap-filling algorithm for sensor networks, partnering
closely with field engineers to ensure our models respected real-world noise and downtiime. At
[compaany], I transitioned from prototype to production, embedding fraud-detection models into
high-throughput payment systems with strict reliability SLAs. More recentlly, I helped launch an
AI-driven startuup that integrates LLM-based orchestration with molecular-dynamics
simulations—an initiative where I had the privilege of coordinating both technical and
cross-functional teams to ensure smooth deployment.
My current research, an LLM-driven platform for Molecular Dynamics, employs reinforcement
learning to optimize molecular structures and generative routines to design simulation inputs.
I’m now exploring how to extend this work with multimodal agents that synthesize visual,
textual, and time-series data, all while embedding safety-aware learning protocols for robusst
autonomous operation. SMILES’s workshops on safe AI and multimodal coordination are
exactly the structured deep dive I need to take these ideas from prototype to industry-grade
solutions.
Beyond the labs, I value the cultural and intellectual exchange that SMILES fosters. Having
studied alonsgside [location] classmates at [compaany], I’ve learned
to appreciate diverse problem-solving styles and communication norms. I look forward to
buildiing on this by learning Mandarin greetings, sharing Russian hospitality, and engaging in
joint discussions that spark fresh perspectives on AI’s global challenges.
In joining SMILES, I hope to contribute not only my technical skills but also the collaboraative
spirit cultivated through international teamwork and my experience shepherding early-stage AI
projects. I am confident that this immersiive program will deepen my expertise, strengthen ties
between [compaany] and [location] of Science and Technology, and empower me to deliver
scalable, safe AI solutions with real-world impaact.
Thank you for considering my application. It would be an honor to learn from—and contribute
to—the vibrant SMILES community in [location].
Warm regards,
[name].
