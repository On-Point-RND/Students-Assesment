I am looking forward to participate in SMILES 2025 because it is a rare opportunity to get knowledge from the experts of such high level and to meet new people from ML worldwide community who love ML just like me. I checked the topics from previous years and they seemed pretty advanced to me. I like understanding hard things and isn’t SMILES a perfect place where I can seek help and inspiration for this? I really want to dive deep into multimodal models and generative models though I am interested in any DL in general.
As for my experience, I am used to working with PyTorch, pandas, tensorflow. I’ve completed NLP course from [compaany], MIPT DLS course on [compaany] and I am currently attending [compaany] DL course and having practice at [compaany] where I work on CV models. All of my university/pet projects were dedicated to ML/DL in some way. For now my main interest is Reinforcement Learning and its application in Robotics, but I regularly try something new as I’m still an amateur.
As for career, it would be perfect for me to do significant research projects that really change something in the sphere and life. I like seeing mathematical beauty behind approaches and wish I could once create something beautiful. I am definitely going for my Master’s and still thinking about getting PhD as well.
