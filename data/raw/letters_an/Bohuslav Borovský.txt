To: Organizing Committee [compaany]
Date: 20.04.2025
Dear Members of the Organizing Committee,
My name is [name], and I am a researcher with eight years of
experience in molecular biology and breast cancer studies. Currently, I am also
pursuing a master’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Physics at [compaany] and
completing a professional retraining program titled "Fundamentals of Machine
Learning and Deep Learning," which grants the qualification of "Big Data Specialist
utilizing an organization’s existing methodological and technological infrastructure." I
am already applying the knowledge gained to address professional challenges
involving data analysis using basic machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
methods. Participating in your school represents a unique opportunity for me to
deepen my skills in ML/DL and apply them to solve pressing challenges in
biomedical research.
My professional activity is focused on identifying cancer biomarkers and developing
new diagnostic and therapeutic methods. However, modern biological research
generates enormous volumes of data, and traditional analysis methods are no longer
sufficient for processing it. This is where ML/DL methods come into play, enabling
the identification of complex patterns in data, predicting therapy effectiveness, and
even discovering new biomarkers.
The [compaany] SMILES 2025 School attracts me with its interdisciplinary focus and
the opportunity to work on real-world projects at the intersection of biology and data
science. I am confident that participating in the school will not only allow me to
master cutting-edge ML/DL methods but also teach me how to integrate them into
my research. Furthermore, I highly value the opportunity to exchange experiences
with colleagues from various fields, which could lead to new ideas and
collaborations.
Experience with ML/DL Tools
Although my primary expertise lies in experimental biology, I am actively mastering
data analysis and machine learning tools. As part of my master's program at [compaany], I
am studying Python, R, and SQL, along with basic machine learning concepts.
Additionally, I apply these skills in my research:
 NGS Data Analysis: I use Bowtie and Bowtie2 for sequencing data
processing, as well as Python for statistical analysis of results.
 Image Processing: I work with ImageJ for analyzing microscopic images of
cells, requiring automation skills and handling large datasets.
 Predictive Modeling: In one of my projects, I utilized regression methods to
analyze the relationship between gene expression and clinical parameters in
breast cancer patients.
Expectations from the School
I see participation in the [compaany] SMILES 2025 School as a significant step in my
professional development. Specifically, I expect:
1. In-depth ML/DL Study: To expand my knowledge and better understand
modern algorithms, such as neural networks, ensemble methods, and natural
language processing techniques, to apply them to biomedical data analysis.
2. Practical Skills: To work on real-world projects that will enable me to
immediately apply the acquired knowledge to my scientific activities.
3. Networking: The school offers an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals,
exchange ideas, and potentially initiate collaborative projects.
4. Career Growth: I am confident that these new competencies will help me
become a more sought-after specialist at the intersection of biology and data
science.
Career Plans
My long-term goal is to become a leading researcher in the field of personalized
medicine, where ML/DL methods play a key role. In the coming years, I plan to:
1. Integrate ML into my research: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze
genomic data and identify new cancer biomarkers.
2. Develop interdisciplinary projects: Collaborate with bioinformaticians and
data science specialists to create tools for predicting therapy effectiveness.
3. Continue education: I am considering pursuing a Ph.D. or participating in
additional educational programs to deepen my knowledge in artificial
intelligence.
Participation in the [compaany] SMILES 2025 School will be an important milestone on
this path, providing me with the knowledge and connections necessary to realize my
ambitions.
Thank you for the opportunity to apply. I would be honored to contribute to the
school’s work and make the most of this chance for professional growth.
Sincerely,
[name]
