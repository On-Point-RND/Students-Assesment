Dear [name] [surname] Organization Committee,
I am writing to express my strong interest in joining the Skoltech Summer School of Machine Learning 2025. Having had the opportunity to participate in SMILES-2024, I was inspired by the quality of instruction (especially [name] [surname]'s course on GANs), the collaborative environment, and the community of passionate researchers, many of which became good friends and colleagues of mine. That experience strengthened my commitment to a career in AI research and raised a particular interest in generative models that are still a part of the agenda for this year’s school.
Currently, I am pursuing my Master’s in Information Technologies and Engineering at [compaany], specializing in Internet of Things and Wireless Technologies. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics with honors from [compaany], where I first discovered the field of data science. Since then, I’ve devoted myself to the research in the field of AI and still am interested in further development in the field beyond my university studies.
At Skoltech’s LARSS Laboratory, I am working on research involving concealed adversarial attacks in sequential models. This has introduced me to the complexity and potential of models’ vulnerabilities, which also broadened my research interest further in the direction of uncertainty analysis.
While my current work is related to time series and sequential modeling, I’m willing to broaden my experience to other domains. SMILES-2025 represents a unique opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of generative and multimodal AI, especially in real-world applications and various fields, since my experience is still somewhat limited to domains I primarily work with at the moment.
I am particularly excited about the hands-on workshops and hackathons, which would provide the opportunity to work on real projects from a variety of mentors and areas and gain experience out of my usual research environment. This, I believe, is very crucial since we can observe the ongoing trend in machine learning connected to the use of large language models and multi-agent systems. Understanding these areas is key to keeping up with both research and what's happening in the industry.
Beyond technical growth, I’m also motivated by the school’s international nature. I am excited to be part of a diverse and international group of participants. I believe in the value of collaboration between [location] and [location] students and researchers in today’s rapidly evolving technological world, especially in the light of strengthening cooperation between our countries, and I hope to build connections that lead to meaningful, long-term collaboration that is beneficial for both countries' technological future.
In the long term, I plan to pursue a PhD and continue working on research at the intersection of AI theory and applied machine learning. Although my current Master’s specialization is more engineering-focused, my academic interests and future ambitions are firmly rooted in data science and AI, and SMILES-2025 would be a key step on that path.
I look forward to the possibility of joining SMILES again, this time with a deeper perspective, new questions, and the drive to contribute even more.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
