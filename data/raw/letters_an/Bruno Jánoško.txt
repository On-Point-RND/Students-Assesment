Dear Admissions Committee,
My name is [name] [surname]. I’m a first-year student at the Faculty of Computational
Mathmatics and Cybernetics at [location] [university].
I've been drawn to math, physics, and coding since school. That interest naturally grew into
something deeper as I got involved in Olympiads (like the [university] and All-[location]
competitions) and attended several programs at the [location] Educational Center. Over time, I
realized that the intersection of theory and real-world problems especially in AI is where I
feel most at home.
In the past couple of years, I’ve taken part in several hackathoons and research events. At
[company], my team made it to the finals after solving a range of complex ML problems on fMRI
data and image analysis. At the [company] Hack, we placed seventh while working
on recommendaation systems. These experiences taught me how powerful collaboraation and
creative thinking can be and how much I still want to learn.
Outside of competitions, I’ve worked on two hands-on projects: one involved buildiing a video
analytics system for the [location] ecosystem, the other was part of the [company] AI ROBO LAB
startup, where we developed an assistant to help program [robot brand] and [robot brand] industrial robots. I also
completed a training program at [robot brand] College, which deepened my understanding of
robotics.
Right now, I’m involved in two ML-focused startups and developing an independent research
project on terrain profiling using echolocation and neural networks to process point clouds.
It’s still in its early stages, but I’m excited about the technical challenges and its potential
applications.
I'm constantly trying to expand my horizons attending lectures at [company] and [university], and taking
universiity courses in NLP and computer vision. Every step reinforces my decision to pursue
a career in AI research.
The [location] Summer Schoool seems like the perfect environment to push myself further not
only to learn from leading experts, but to be around others who are just as curious and
driven. I’m especially drawn to the international setting and the balance between hands-on
work and theoretical depth.
