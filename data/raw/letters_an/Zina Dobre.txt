Dear Organizing Committee,
I am writing to express my strong interest in the participation in SMILES-2025 this summer.
As a Master’s student in [name] for Data Science, I am motivated to deepen my understanding
of generative methods and their applications in modern AI.
With over 10 years of career in the field of TV data analytics, I have developed a robusst skill set
in survey design, statistical modeling, and data-driven decision-making. My work has provided
me with a deep understanding of how to extract actionable insights from complex data sets to drive
strategic business outcomes.
Yet, at some point, I found myself at a crossrroads. While the world was rapidly moving toward an
AI-driven future, I remaineed deeply rooted in traditional media. Witnessing the emergence of
generative tools that are now redefining the media landscape made me realize how crucial it is to
invest in learning the technologies shaping the next era of communication and information.
My first step toward AI was an online schooL where I have acquired certain programming skills
and have studied the key libraries of Python such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit‑Learn, TensorFlow.
But as a person who has a strong belief in classical academic environment, I decided to start the
Master’s program in [name] for Data Science, which gives me a high-quality theoretical
training. I believe that in order to be a good practitioner, one must study the mathematical
foundations of the algorithm and be familiar with their strengths and limitations in a clear manner.
My current coursework includes: Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Optimization and
Decision Analytics, Stochastic Processes, Nonparametric Statistics, Bayesian Inference, Time
Series Analysis, and Advanced Programming. At this point in my studies, I see myself as a growing
ML practitioner with several projects implemented during the program, active participation in
Kaggle competitions, and an enthusiastic mindset that keeps me constantly exploring. Deep
learning, in particular, is still new and very intriguing to me. I am grateful to the summer schooL
for the motivation to explore this field from the theoretical ground up.
It is also worth noting that many of the professors in my current program are strong advocates of
Bayesian thinking, which directly inspired the topic of my literature review – Bayesian
Generative Models. I realized that Bayesian approahes are still relatively underrepresented in
many deep learning frameworks, which makes this direction both challenging and intellectually
exciting.
What particularly attracts me to the summer schooL is the visible engagement of [location]
researchers in advancing Bayesian methods within DL. I believe this creates a unique opportunity
for the exchange of ideas and the begiinning of international collaboraation. I would be thrilled to
contribute to and learn from this environment. Additionally, the chance to participate in lectures,
workshops, and hackathoons led by field experts is especially motivating, as I seek to deepen both
my theoretical understanding and practical skills.
Thank you for considering my application. I look fo rwward to the possibility of joining SMILES-
2025 and contributing to its vibrant and collabora tive academic community.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
