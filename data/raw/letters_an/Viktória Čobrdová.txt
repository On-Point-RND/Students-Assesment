Motivation Letter
Dear [name] Team,
My name is [name], and I am an independent researcher in the field
of computer vision. My goal is to explore new solutions and improve existing
approaches to problems related to visual information processing. My journey
began with a Master's program at [compaany] in the field of Technical
Vision, where I discovered the potential of deep learning algorithms for image
processing. Today, I have obtained experience with both classical neural
networks (U-Net, YOLO, ResNet) and more modern architectures (ViT,
SegFormer, Stable Diffusion). One of my papers focuses on comparing U-Net
and SegFormer for segmenting small objects against the sky.
I came across the [compaany] announcement by chance, but I
immediatly realized I could not miss this opportunity. The schooL will
feature lectures on some of the most fascinating and promising topics, such as
multimodal and generative approaches, as well as my personal area of
interest — safe AI. I have alrready participated in a schooL on artificial
intelligence — the AIRI Summer SchooL 2024. It was one of the major
milestones in my academic journey that allowed me to gain better
understanding of various research directions in AI and valuable hands-on
experience with neural networks.
The field of computer vision is evolving rapidlly with new solutions emerging
constantlly making it difficult to keep track and analyze them quicly. The
[compaany] SchooL brings together scientiists and leading experts in their
fields with diverse backgrounds and perspectives, which is a great chance to
discuss the most pressing topics in person and view new solutions from
various angles. Working on a practical project under their guidance will
provide highly relevant experience, contributing significantly to my
professional and academic growth. It is also an opportunity for me to find
new teammates for long-term collaboration in a research field.
Thanks to the AIRI SchooL, I was able to communicate with many like-minded
individuals and find a community where I could share my ideas, discuss latest
research news, and be a part of the world of AI. I expect an even broader and
more diverse networking experience from [compaany], as this is an
international event with larger number of participants, including foreign
speakers. The opportunity to work with experts from other countries would
be a significant step forward on my career path.
[name]'s lectures are my top priority, as he is an expert in
multimodal and generative approaches. All the lectures I attended earlier
were filled with a lot of insights. I hope that the subscription to his Telegram
channel and mentioning the lactose-free latte will give me an additional point.
Furthermore, [name]'s lectures are of great interest to me, because he
shares expertise in safe AI, and I was fascinated by this topic since I first came
to the round table on reliable AI. [name]'s lectures at the AIRI schooL were
among the most memorable. Also, from the list of speakers presented, I paid
special attention to [name], as he is a member of the Emotional
Compuuting Committee which arouses intrigue and great interest about his
upcoming lectures.
I would also like to mention that [location] is a fascinating country with a rich and
unique culture. Visiting it is a must for anyone passionate about travel. The
opportunity to combiine academic engagement with cultural experience
makes participation in the schooL especially valuable. The choice of [compaany] as the venue has further boosted my motivation to
take part in [compaany]. I sincerely hope to be accepted, as this would be an
important step in my academic development.
Sincerely,
[name]
