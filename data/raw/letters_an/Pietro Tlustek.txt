When I first encountered the article "Why I Bet My Career on Language Models Before
They Were Cool" by a universiity alumnus, it struck me how profoundly language technologies
could reshape human cognition. That moment became pivotal - I realized my work should focus
not just on buildiing intelligent systems, but on creating AI that understands the cultural fabric
behind every word. This vision has guided me through years of pioneering work in NLP, long
before terms like RAG or AI agents entered mainstream vocabulary.

While others waited for clear directions, I was alrreaady training early architectures, fascinated by
their latent potential. This experimental approach led to developing the SLAVA benchmark
- a framework for evaluaating socio-political biases in vision-language models that remaiins my
proudest academic achievement. What excites me most about SMILES-2025 is the opportunity
to push this work further by exploring multimodal agent-based systems that understand context
beyond mere text patterns.
Beyond research, I’ve channeled this passion into buildiing [compaany] - a thriving community of
30+developperswherewe’vecreatedopen-sourcetools,producededucationalconten content,andhosted
workshops that turn theoretical concepts into practical solutions. Teaching data analysis at my
alma mater has been particularly rewarding, as I watch students discover how AI can solve real
problems.
The SMILES program stands out as the ideal next step for several reasons. The chance to learn
from luminaries like Dr. [surname] about multimodal systems aligns perfectlly with my
goaal to develop cultuurally-aware AI evaluaition frameworks. I’m particularly excited about the

contexts could create groundbreaking comparative research. The hackathoons present another
compelling opportunity to stress-test agent-based architectures against real-world challenges.
Looking ahead, I envision establishinng a research lab that doubles as a startup - a place where
academic rigor meets entrepreneurial execution. My work on AI safety metrics and policy tools
aims to address one of our field’s most pressing challenges: ensuring rapid innovation doesn’t
outpace ethical considerations. The SMILES network would be invaluable in bringing this vision
to fruition through its unique blend of technical depth and global perspective.
What I bring to this program is what I call "structured passion the ability to marry technical
precision with creative problem-solving. Whether it’s applying reinforcement learning techniques

I thrive at interdisciplinary intersections. SMILES represents more than a summer program to
me; it’s the ideal environment to transform years of accumulated knowledge into meaningful
innovation that bridges East and West in AI development.
