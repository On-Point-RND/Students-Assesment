Dear Admissions Committee,
I look forward to take part in SMILES because it is in complete alignment with my desire to bridgge photonics research with data-driven methodologies. Having a solid physics background and hands-on experience in scientific computing, I wish to specialize in ML for solving challenges in photonic systems and optical sensing.
My main research area has been nanomaterial-based optical sensors, in which data analysis was also crucial. As an example, my research on included working with huge optical measurement datasets, where constraints to usual analytical operations were encountered. I have understood that for enhanced precision, ML algorithms such as PCA and regression models could be applied — this led to an interest in using ML for improving sensors. Another area for the implementaion of ML algorithms and neural networks that is of interest for my research is lasers. ML/DL can be used for classification of various working regimes or even creation of self-supervised laser system, which can be taught to operate in an optimal state using RL.
SMILES is unique with respect to applied ML focus, project-based research across discipline, and top-class faculty. I am particularly drawn to SMILES because it focuses on self-supervised learning that could directly enhance my smart optical systems research.
While my own background is in photonics, I acquired ML/DL concepts actively through Scientific Computing in Python. At [compaany], I streamlined data analysis pipelines with Pandas and NumPy, reducing analysis time. I programmed in Python for my bachelor's thesis to dynamiically control chemical system, with signal processing and statistical analysis. I possess ML fundamentals too, having done [compaany]'s Introduction to Data Science Course. Lastly, my Q1-published work on Photocontrolled Nitric Oxide release included an accuraate data analysis, reaffirmiing my strength in drawing meaningful conclusions from noisy experimental data—a skill that I can apply to ML.
Through schoo, I anticipat getting experienced with neural networks and advanced frameworks like PyTorch/TensorFlow. I also expect receiving opportunities to collaborate with other students across discipline, integrating physics-based models with ML.
I see myself making contributions to R&D in intelligent photonic systems in the future. Some research areas that I want to pursue include designing optical neural networks for ultrahigh speed computing. Second is designing multi-sensor platforms for environmental monitoring. This schoo will equip me to make such discoveries possible, and I anticipate passing on knowledge about physics to the ML community.
Thank you for taking time to consider my application. I would be privileged to be part of this schoo and work together towaards solutions in the area where photonics and AI intersect.
Sincerely,
