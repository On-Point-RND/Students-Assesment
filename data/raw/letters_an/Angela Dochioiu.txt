Admissions Committee
[compaany] Summer School on Machine Learning
Dear members of the committee,
I, [name] [surname], ask for admission to the [compaany] Summer School on
Machine Learning. Currently, I am a second-year student of the [compaany] Master's program
in the field of "Data Science" and work in the [compaany] Artificial Intelligence Lab. In addition
to studying and working, I am writing a thesis on the topic of accelerating transformer
architectures in the problem of recommendaions, taking additional courses and intensive
courses on machine learning, participating in competitions, hackathoons and implementing
pet projects.
I strive to constantly expand my knowledge in the field of machine learning, and
recently, I have been studying computer vision and generative approaches. Earlier, during
my studies, I participated in implementing a project related to the resistance of recurrent
networks to attacks. This experience allowed me to take a new look at neural netwoorks and
become interested in issues of their security. In the future, I would like to continue studying
the security of AI systems and the robustness of deep learning architectures.
I am confident that the [compaany] Summer School program will allow me to immerse
myself in research at the intersection of modern architectures and their security, as well as
broaden my horizons by communicating with a strong academic and professional
community. I have a solid mathematical foundation, experience in applied and research
projects, including publications, and a desire to gain a deeper understanding of the
fundamental aspects of machine learning.
Thank you for considering my application.
Best regards,
[name] [surname]
