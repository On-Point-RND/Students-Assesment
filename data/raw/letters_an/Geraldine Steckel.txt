Motivation Letter for SMILES 2025
Dear SMILES Admissions Committee,
I was insanely looking forward to the new enrollment for this school! At the beginning of my letter I would like to thank the organizers, for their annual work and for the fact that every year
SMILES!
My name is [name] [surname], and I am completing my first year in a master’s program at [compaany] Data Science. I am currently working on machine unlearning for large language models (LLM) in collaboration with [name] [surname] NLP [compaany] Lab and Applied NLP lab at [name] [surname].
I have accumulated two years of experience working at [compaany], where I was also engaged in NLP and LLM projects. During my tenure, I consistently delivered high efficiency and successful outcomes. I led two major projects to production for our clients: an AI assistant (RAG) for customer support chat featuring a proprietary knowledge graph construction logic and retrieval engine, and a text clustering algorithm based on Siamese networks for dimensionality reduction that outperforms traditional methods (e.g., dimensionality reduction plus clustering, such as UMAP with clustering). This experience has taught me how to work effectively in a team, utilize modern frameworks on real-world data under high-pressure conditions, and set tasks efficiently to achieve excellent results in short timeframes.
However, research has always been my passion. I have always aspired to engage in scientific endeavors, become an integral part of the AI community, participate in innovative research, and share my findings with peers. That is why I enrolled in a master’s program and have dedicated significant effort to both my studies and research. Despite the rigorous and fast-paced curriculum, I have maintained excellent academic performance.
Some of the most interesting and impactful courses I have taken in my first year include Bayesian Methods in Machine Learning—where we transitioned from traditional Bayesian models to modern GenAI approaches such as VAEs, GANs, and diffusion techniques—Transformers in Computer Vision, focusing on modern multimodal models and computer vision methods, and currently, a course on Parallel LLM Training. In this course, we explore the intricacies of training modern neural networks such as Qwen and Llama, study GPU and CPU architectures, implement matrix computations, and work with C++ optimizers like Muon and Adafwd. We also analyze Flash Attention in detail by calculating gradients and FLOPs to thoroughly understand the algorithm from A to Z, and we train popular models like Llama using Triton. I genuinely enjoy exploring various LLM training techniques.
There are courses at the school that strongly overlap with my current research interests (LLMs, Safe AI) and will allow me to deepen the knowledge I gained through [compaany] courses (GenAI, Multimodal). Many of the lecturers and professors are also familiar to me from those courses — I deeply admire their work and would love to attend their new lectures. Moreover, this year SMILES provides a great opportunity to connect with professors from a top [location] university!
The school also covers the most trending and fast-developing AI directions this year, which will help me dive into new topics I haven’t yet had the chance to explore. I’m genuinely interested in all the topics presented at the school, and I truly believe it’s a perfect match for me!
I’ve participated in SMILES for the past two years and have always been fascinated by the school’s topics, inspiring lecturers, and challenging projects. Last year, I took part in [name] [surname]’s project on LLM hallucination classification using topological features. I learned a lot and was able to successfully complete the project. However, working in a team remotely was quite challenging, and I’m sure that in-person participation would allow me to dive even deeper into the project work, and in-person collaboration with teammates would bring even better results. I’m really looking forward to the chance to challenge myself again and create something exciting over those 1.5–2 weeks!
Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
