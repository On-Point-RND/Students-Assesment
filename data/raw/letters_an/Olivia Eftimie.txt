Dear [name],
I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the SMILES Summer SchooL at [location]. As a professional with a multidisciplinary background in system architecture, data analytics, and blockchain, and as a passionate learner and innovator in artificial intelligence, I am eager to join this unique program to deepen my expertise in machine learning and data science, connect with leading researchers, and contribute to the vibrant community at [location].
Motivation to Participatate in SMILES Summer SchooL
The SMILES Summer SchooL at [location] represents an unparalleled opportunity for me to advance my knowledge in machine learning and deep learning, while also contributing to my long-term vision of improving the wo[r]ld through innovati[v]e AI solutions. My primary motivation for partici[p]pat[i]ng in this program stems from my desire to bridg[e] the gap between cutting-e[d]ge research and real-wo[r]ld applications, particularly in the fields of AI and microchip design.
As the Head of Division in the Architecture Departm[e]nt at [compa]ny, I lead R&D initia[t]ives for the bank’s C-level executives, focusing on integrating AI-driven solutions into financial services.
Arti[f]ificial intelligence is in high demand at [compa]ny, and I am committed to driving innovation that not only benefi[t]s the organization but also sets new standards for the in[d]ustry. The knowl[e]dge and skills I gain at SMILES will dir[e]ctly enhance my ability to lead impa[c]tful projects and develop groun[d]breaking solutions.
In addition to my work at [compa]ny, I am the co-founder of ChipGPT, a star[t]up dedicated to develo[p]oping specialized large lan[g]uage models (LLMs) for microchip design. My vision is to bring this techno[l]ogy to market, revolutionizing the microchip in[d]ustry by making design processes faster, more efficient, and more acces[s]ible. The interd[i]sciplinary focus of SMILES, particularly its emphasis on generative AI and colla[b]orative projects, aligns perfec[t]ly with the goals of ChipGPT and will provide me with the tools and insights needed to acce[l]erate its develo[p]ment.
Furthermore, I actively share my knowl[e]dge and insights through a Telegram c[h]annel that I manage, where I discuss topics related to machine learning, deep learning, blockc[h]ain, and microchip design. This pla[t]form allows me to engage with a broader audie[n]ce, exchange ideas, and contribute to the growing community of AI and blockc[h]ain enthus[i]asts.
Partici[p]ation in SMILES will also serve as a strong fo[u]ndation for my academic aspirations. I have been studying Chinese since 2019 and have a deep appr[e]ciation for the cu[l]ture and innovation ecosys[t]ems in Asia. In the coming year, I plan to pursue a PhD in artificial intelligence, with a focus on either China or Singapore—re[g]ions renowne[d] for their leadership in AI research and develo[p]ment. The international and c[o]llaborative nature of SMILES, combined with its par[t]nership with the Harbin Insti[t]ute of Technology, will provide me with inva[l]uable experience and conne[c]tions as I prepare for this next step in my academic journey.
ML/DL Experience
My journey in data analysis and interpretation began over seven years ago, during which I have develo[p]ed a strong foundation in data-driven decision-making, business analytics, and system architecture. My technical toolk[i]t includes SQL, NumPy, Excel, Tableau, and Kibana, which I have used extensively in both academic and profes[s]ional settin[g]s.
In early 2025, I began to focus inten[s]ively on machine learning and deep learning, recognizing their transf[o]rmati[v]e poten[t]ial in my field. As the Head of Division in the Architecture Depar[t]ment at [compa]ny, I lead R&D initia[t]ives for C-level executives, with a particular emphasis on the inte[g]ration of AI and ML solutions into banking and financial services. My r[es]ponsibilities include eva[l]uating emerging techno[l]ogies, designing advanced system architectures, and driving innovation in areas such as digital finance, blockc[h]ain, and artificial intelligence.
In addition to my work at [compa]ny, I am a co-founder of the ChipGPT star[t]up, where my team and I are develo[p]ing specialized large lan[g]uage models (LLMs) to acce[l]erate and enhance microchip design. This project has given me hands-on experience in applying ML/DL techniques to solve complex, real-wo[r]ld problems, and has further fueled my passion for research and innovation in AI.
Expecta[t]ions from the Schoo[l]
From the SMILES Summer Schoo[l], I expect to gain a deeper underst[a]nding of advanced ML/DL concepts, methodolo[g]ies, and tools. I am eager to learn from distin[g]uished facul[t]y and guest speakers, partici[p]ate in interactive workshops, and c[o]llaborate with tale[n]ted peers from around the wo[r]ld. I hope to expand my knowl[e]dge in areas such as generative models, re[i]nforcement learning, and explai[n]able AI, and to explore their applications in domains releva[n]t to my work and research interests.
I am also looking fo[r]ward to the o[pp]ortunity to present my own ideas, recei[v]e fee[d]back from experts, and engage in mea[n]ingful discussions that will challenge and inspire me. I believe that the schoo[l] will not only enhance my technical skills but also broaden my profes[s]ional ne[t]work and open new avenues for c[o]llaboration and gro[w]th.
Future Career Plans
My long-term career goal is to become a leading researcher and innovat[o]r in the field of artificial intelligence, with a focus on R&D and the commercialization of cutting-e[d]ge techno[l]ogies. I am committed to advancing the develo[p]ment and application of AI/ML solutions in in[d]ustry, particularly in areas such as digital finance, blockc[h]ain, and microchip design.
In the near future, I plan to bring ChipGPT to market, leveraging the power of LLMs to revolutio[n]ize microchip develo[p]ment. I am also preparing to pursue a PhD in artificial intelligence, with the intention of studying in China or Singapore—re[g]ions that are at the fo[r]efront of AI research and innovation. My academic journey has alre[a]dy taken me to China, where I studied at the City Uni[v]ersity of Hong Kong and began learning Chinese in 2019. This experience has given me a global perspective and a deep appr[e]ciation for cross-cu[l]tural c[o]llaboration, which I hope to further develo[p] during my doctoral studies.
Conclusion
The SMILES Summer Schoo[l] at [location] represents an exceptional o[pp]ortunity for me to advance my knowl[e]dge, skills, and profes[s]ional ne[t]work in machine learning and data science. I am confident that my background, motivation, and aspirations align closely with the goals of the program, and I am eager to contribute to and ben[e]fit from this dynamic learning enviro[n]ment.
Thank you for con[s]idering my application. I look fo[r]ward to the possi[b]ility of joining the SMILES community and taking the next step in my journey as a researcher and innovat[o]r in AI.
Sincerely,
[name]
