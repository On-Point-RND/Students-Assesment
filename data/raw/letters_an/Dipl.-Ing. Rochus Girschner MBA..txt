Dear [compaany] Committee,
My name is [name] [surname]. I’m currently studying Computing and Data Science at the [compaany]. I’ve applied to [compaany] because I believe that truly fascinated about the power of creation and adaptation granted by the artificial intelligence. I also understand that guiding and constraining models is important, both
for safety and correctness.
My interests are at the intersection of structuraal and creative. I’m fascinated by
generative models, but even more so by how we might guide and constrain them —
through verification, formal methods, or self-supervised signals — to align with our
intent. I have successfully tried Q-learning agents for the games of Tetris and Pacman.
The themes of [compaany] resonate deeply with my goals: multimodal reasoning,
large language models, safe and correct AI. I see this schoo not just as a learning
opportunity, but as a chance to exchange ideas with others who see machine learning
not only as engineering, but as an art form with rules waiting to be discovered. I would
be excited to contribute to and learn from this enviroment.
Sincerely, [name] [surname]
