Dear committee!
My name is [name], I am a fourth-year student at the Faculty of Bioengineering and
Bioinformatics, [location]. I learned about SMILES-2025 with great interest and
would like to express my desire to become a part of your team, because it seems to me that this year’s
topics could significantly help in the development of my research.
During my studies, I have successfully completed courses in Python, algorithms and data structures,
the R language, SQL, big data processing, machine learning and deep learning.
In addition to my theoretical knowledge, I have practical experience in EDA projects and projects
related to the analysis of biological data (statistical analysis of differential gene expression, diabetes
prediction based on medical indicators using ML models).
My career as a researcher began in [compaany] with analyzing the evolution of regulatory elements in
RNA-binding proteins. I used classical methods and approaches based on dynamic programming and
heuristic algorithms: sequence alignments, BLAST, structural alignment.
This work made me acutely aware of the limitations of traditional approaches in the field. At the
same time, AI's triumphs were becoming increasinglly prominent: AlphaFold made global headlines
by outppeorformiing all other teams in CASP 13 (competition in proteiin structure prediction). Previoulsy,
the CASP had been deeply frustrating for me: the first places were taken by the “online community” -
the task of predicting the structure was gamified and proposed to players worldwide.
Teams of Nobel-winning scientists were losing to people playing a game. How could it be?
The emergence of AlphaFold changed everytthing. I find this example deeply inspiring: on one hand,
it's not an out-of-the-box algorithm that completely eliminates the need for domain experts; on the
other hand, it's the extensive work of specialists in the field of ML that made such a breakthrough
possible. This is a stunniingly beautiful example of collabora<bos>*tive work. I believe the future of science
lies precisely at the intersection of machine learning and professional expertise.
These thoughts motivated me to delve into machine learning. First, I enrolled in “Claassical machine
learning” course at the Institute for Theoretical and Mathematical Physics, (alongside my core studies)
and later completed a deep learning program. In 2024, I graduaed from Deep Learning Schoo*l at
MIPT. Through these experiences, I have gained a solid founda*tion in modern deep learning.
This year I joined a research group in [location] focused on applying machine learning to biology. I had
the privileg*e of working under [surname], captain of the wi**ing team in the Dr*am Challenge
2022 competition and a Nature-published author.
Currrentl*y, I am working on a project titled "Annotation and Prioritiza*ion of Non-Coding Variants
Using Modern Neural Netwo*ks." A key challenge is that models like transformer-based Enforme*r
and LLMs often overlook the effe*ts of single-nucleo*tide mutations, despite their critical role in

disease develo*ment. My goal is to train neural netwo*ks on personalized genomes to address this
limitation and make such models applicable for personalized medicine.
As I am focusing on sequence-to-activity models, I can’t help noticing that not all biologica*l
interactions can be explained solely by sequences. Thus, I was excited to know that there is a chance
to study about the implementa*ions of Multimodal approa*hes at SMILES-2025.
In my field, so-called “omics” data (genomics, proteo*mics, transcriptomics) is widely used, so the
application of multimodal systems hold great promise. The Schoo*l of Computer Science and
Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology is also exploring this field, so I would welcome the
oppo*rtunity to learn about their experience firsthand.
Another line of work that captures my imagination is generating DNA sequences with specific
properties. My colleagues have made significant progress in the creation of tissue-specific promoters -
genetic elements that activate genes in target cells while remaining inactive in others. It opens
promising avenues, for example, for tumor treatments, where it is critical to avoid healthy cells.
Currrentl*y, this field remai*ns underexplored, with relatively few research groups working on it. I
believe studying from first-class professi*nals like [surname], who stand behind projects like
Kandinsky, could prove highly fruitful. Thei*r experti*se in controlle*d generation could be adapted to
create tailored DNA sequences with desired regulatory profiles.
Earlier this year, I participated in the Yandex and MIP*T "Artificial Intelligence" schoo*l. where I
worked on a project about application of parenclitic netwo*ks to fraud detection in banking. I chose
the field because I wanted to gain hand-on experience with this metho* because of its high poten*l in
genomic tasks.
I have alrrea*y discussed with my supervisor the idea of using parenclitic netwo*ks to complement
GWAS (genome-wide association study) and differential expression analysis in identifying
disease-associa*ted genes. This will become my side project after completing my current work.
The ability to comprehensively identify disease-linked genes is crucial in medicine. While full
genome sequencing remai*ns costl*y, targeted marker panels are often used instea*d - incomplete panels
risk missing critical mutations, poten*lly hindering disease prevention. Parenclitic netwo*ks could
help find the previously unknown biomarkers.
What I'm looking fo*ward to most at SMILES-2025 is meeting [name], as I'm both intrigued and
inspired by his series of works on the 'bles*sing of dimensi*lity'. As all ML students, I have been
repeatedl* told about the “curs* of dimensi*lity” and approa*ches to overcome it so it seemed an
undeniable truth. His fresh perspective feels counterintuitive yet thought-provoking. A scienti*st,
marching against the cliché, represents precisely the schoo*l of thought I wish to apprentice myself to.
Addititionaly, his extensive experience working at Japan’s RIKEN Brain Science Institute deeply
influenced this brain-inspired theory. It makes me wonder: what other biologica*l principles could
shape AI’s evolution? Could I not onl*y apply AI to natural science, but also explore the reverse —
applying insights from natural science to advance AI?
I am eager to contribute my interdisciplinary background in bioinformatics and machine learning to
SMILES-2025, while learning from leading researchers like [name]. This program’s focus on
multimodal approa*hes aligns perfectl*y with my goal to enhance my sequence-to-activity model by
integrating diverse types of biologica*l data - and so advance personalized medicine. I am sure that a

chance to participat*e in SMILES-2025 will give me a huge career boost and our work will be fruitful
for both parties.
With respect,
