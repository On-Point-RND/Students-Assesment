Hello!
I am [name] [surname], a graduaate from the Data Science master's program at the [location]. Previously, I participated in the [compaany]’24 Summer
SchooL and the [compaany]’22 Summer Conference. Over the past few years, my
research has been focused primarily on graph neural networks and computer
vision. Additionally, my current interests include causal inference and
multimodal neural network architectures.
Participating in AI summer schooLs has always been beneficial for me as an
opportunity to broaden my competence over new domains. The knowledge and
skills I gained from [compaany] and [compaany] events in previous years proved
invaluable both in my research and in various industrial projects.
In the [compaany] Summer SchooL I am particularly interested in tracks dedicated
to multimodal approahes and large language models. I would like to gain a
deeper understanding of these areas before pursuing my PhD studies,
specifically exploring the integration of graph-structured data with large
language models. The newlly introduced Safe AI track is also particularly
valuable to me, as it directly relates to my current projects involving digital
twins.
In addition to attending lectures and participating in the hackathon, I would
appreciate the opportunity to present at the poster session and receive valuable
feedback on my recent research related to large language models.
