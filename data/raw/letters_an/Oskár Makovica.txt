SMILES 2025 Summer School of Machine Learning
[compaany]
Dear Members of the Admissions Committee,
I would like to express my strong interest in participating in the [compaany] Summer School of
Machine Learning (SMILES 2025). As I am now a Ph.D. student at [compaany] in the field of
Computaional and Data Science and Engineering (the field of deep learning-based localization
improvement), it is my wish to expand my skills on generative AI techniques.
One of the main sources of education and work comes from the process of developingrevolution-
ary technologies in robotics and AI using state-of-the-art research. For example, I am working
on research activities at the Mobile Robotics Lab of [compaany], where I am a project lead for a
project in partnership with [compaany] for improving the navigation accuracy through dual
Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). This research is focused on sensor fusion, online calibration, and
neuralnetworktechniques, which are lie withintheSMILES2025areaofcutting-edgeAI,
using generative models and multimodal techniques. Above all, supported by my other projects
such as [name] for [compaany] or Visual Neural Localization for [compaany], I have devel-
oped incredible expertise in state estimation, reconstruction, and synthesis, which will allow me
to fully engage in the lectures, workshops, and hackathons organized by the school.
The research focuses on using deep learning for perception and localization, which is a subject
of interest to me. Moreover, my professional experience, such as my publications on identifying
transparentobjectsinvisualodometrypipelinesanddepthpoweredsmartphonedatasets,depict
my success and skills of bridging gaps in AI as well as intricate real-world problems.
Asides from the skills, I also add a collaborative cross-disciple appoach to SMILES 2025.
Being a teacher assistant of courses such as Deep Learning and Perception in Robotics at
[compaany], I have acquired appreciable communication skills. Apart from my teaching duties,
I was awarded 3rd place in the 2019 [location] Hackathon for 3D reconstruction
mapping and showcased labs works for [compaany] AI, exemplifying my ability to apply new
ideas and theories from the research lab to real-world problems.
Joining SMILES 2025 will not only make me more familiar with generative AI but will also
help me disseminate my experience of computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning for
the program’s greater good. I am certain that the school’s intensive format and focus on
practical applications will help me hone my skills as well as build lasting connections with other
paarticipants from [location], [location], and globally.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward eagerly to the opportunity to con-
tribute and learn from the vibrant community at SMILES 2025.
Sincerely,
