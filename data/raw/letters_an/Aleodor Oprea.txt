Dear [name] [surname] Selection Committee,
I am excited to apply for the SMILES-2025 Summer School on Machine Learning, a unique opportunity to immerse myself in the latest advancements in generative AI alongside leading researchers and peers. As a developer specializing in Vision-Language Models, I am particularly drawn to this year’s focus on multimodal approaches, large language models, and generative methods—areas that directly align with my professional trajectory and passion for building AI systems that bridge visual and linguistic understanding.
My journey in AI has been driven by a relentless curiosity and a knack for adapting to new challenges. While my experience doesn’t include formal competitions or open-source contributions, I’ve honed my skills through hands-on projects, such as developing BERT-based classification systems as a part of university project, working at [company] on improving VLMs OCR abilities. Now as a pet project I am designing a local LLM assistant for smart home automation. These projects have taught me to navigate complex technical landscapes and think creatively about real-world applications—a mindset I’m eager to bring to SMILES’ collaborative environment.
Beyond technical contributions, I’m enthusiastic about supporting the school as a volunteer. Having traveled extensively in [location] and developed a familiarity with its culture and language, I’m well-equipped to assist with logistics, media, or cultural activities, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience for all participants. My ability to organize and connect with people, combined with my fluency in English, would allow me to foster meaningful interactions within this international community.
What excites me most about SMILES-2025 is the chance to learn from and collaborate with experts and peers on pressing challenges in AI. I’m confident that the school’s blend of theory, practice, and cross-cultural exchange will not only expand my technical horizons but also inspire new directions for my work. I would be grateful for the opportunity to contribute my skills, learn from others, and be part of this transformative event.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the possibility of joining SMILES-2025.
Best regards,
