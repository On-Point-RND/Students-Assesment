Dear [name] Organizing Committee,
My name is [name], I am a third-year medical student, and I am genuinely interested in participating in the SMILE 2025 program. My goal is to develop as a scientiist in the field of neuroscience—one who not only conducts research, but also
finnds effective ways to implement scientific developments into clinical practice.
I am particularly interested in the intersection of medicine and digital technologies.
I believe this is a highly promising field with the potential to reshape our
understanding of treatment, disease prognosis, and patient recovery. I am
currentlly studying data science and acquiring skills that enable me to analyze
medical data, build predictive models, and design decision support tools for
clinicians.
As part of SMILE 2025, I would like to develop the project "NeuroRisk.AI"—a
machine learning–based system for predicting the risk of complications following
traumatic brain injury (TBI). This project brings together my interests in
neuroscience, clinical medicine, and data analysis. My goal is to create a tool that
can assist physicians during the early diagnostic and rehabilitation stages—helping
them assess injury severity, forecast recovery potential, and make informed
decisions about patient management.
Participating in SMILE 2025 will allow me to receive valuable feedback, test my
ideas, connect with like-minded peers, and take the first steps toward systematic
scientific work and real-world implementation of my project. In the future, I plan
to pursue a Master’s or PhD program in neurobiology and neurorehabilitation to
deepen my expertise and continue my research in this field.
Sincerely, [name]
