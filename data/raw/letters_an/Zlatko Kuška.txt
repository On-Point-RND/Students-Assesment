Dear Members of the Selection Committee,
My name is [name], and I am a fifth-year student in the Physics Department at [location] [university]. I am writing to express my strong interest in attending the SMILES Summer School on Machine Learning.
In the coming year, I plan to apply neural networks in my thesis research, exploring topics such as graph neural networks. The intensive format of your school will allow me to absorb state-of-the-art methodologies in a short period such as self-supervised learning and multi-agent systems, which I will then probably integrate into my work. Moreover, I am actively searching for a PhD program focused on artificial intelligence, and this school provides a chance to meet and collaborate with experts and fellow students during this in-person event, which will be invaluable for guiding my future path.
I have built a solid foundation in machine learning and deep learning through several university courses, including introductory ML and DL modules and a specialized “Neural Networks in Scientific Research” course offered by [university]. I also developed a personal project titled “Plagiarism Detector for Python Scripts”, which I presented at our project conference organized by the [foundation]. Most recently, my colleagues and I conducted research in quantum machine learning on the trainability of variational quantum algorithms, and I am now preparing our results for publication.
Currently, I am interning as a Machine Learning Engineer at [company]'s Quantum Technologies Center, where I focus on programming and debugging optical neural networks. This experience has already deepened my understanding of ML techniques such as parameter quantization and initialization.
From this summer school, I expect to gain not only cutting-edge technical insights but also a network of peers and mentors in AI. I look forward to engaging in discussions, receiving expert feedback on my thesis ideas, and exploring new technologies that are still outside of my current expertise.
Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that participation in your summer school will significantly enhance my research capabilities and support my long-term goal of pursuing a PhD in artificial intelligence. I look forward to the possibility of joining this summer school.
Sincerely,
[name]
