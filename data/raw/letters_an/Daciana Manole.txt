Dear [name],
My name is [name], and I am currently a fourth-year [university] student specializing in physics and mathematics. I am writing to express my deep interest in participating in the SMILES-2025 Summer School. I believe this program is the perfect environment for me to grow as a machine learning practitioner and researcher — and I am ready to work hard to prove that.
My experience is interesting:
What began as curiosity quickly turned into passion — and real projects. Like many enthusiasts, I first caught the spark through YouTube, diving into the world of neural networks and machine learning. That curiosity led me deeper into the global AI conversation, and soon I was watching diffusion models one day — and reshaping my academic path the next. I decided to devote my course project this year to these models, and I'm currently preparing a talk for the [forum name] at [university name] — my second time participating in this scientific forum.
Professionally, I’ve already brought machine learning into real-world deployment. I developed a computer vision model that is now used at [location] for detecting traffic incidents and counting vehicles in real time. (Proof: News article here) The model was a success, and the project brought new clients and recognition to our company. Now, I am working on integrating this model into our internal server system, dealing with infrastructure-level issues that go beyond my formal responsibilities. But nothing stops me when it comes to pushing a project forward — especially one I believe in.
At university, my enthusiasm didn’t let me stay still either. I actively sought out new labs and new knowledge. I joined the [department name], where I asked to be taken in despite the difference in specialization — and was gladly accepted. There, we worked on various projects including ball tracking and semantic segmentation of medical images. These experiences often turned into energetic competitions over model accuracy — and a deep learning experience in both senses of the word.
What makes my path different is that in early 2024, while officially enrolled in physics and mathematics, I decided to cross academic boundaries. I reached out to a faculty member at the [department name] and asked to work together. In preparation, I completed two full online [course name] courses in just one month to prove I was serious. That spring, I presented a course project on time series forecasting — my first formal research experience in ML — at the [conference name] conference.
At the same time, I started preparing for an interview with an ML company. Though my background was in deep learning, I had to refresh my understanding of classic ML algorithms — and did so in a week. I passed the interview, joined the company, and nearly a year later, I’m still there, now acting as a core team member.
To deepen my understanding of how innovations turn into real impact, I also in November, 2024 enrolled in the [course name] course at [university name] — a newly established, innovation-driven university launched by [organization name]. I chose this program precisely because it shares my focus: building real, ambitious projects at the intersection of technology and entrepreneurship. Taught by [name], PhD (MIT), a venture investor and practitioner, this seven-month course equips us with the mindset and tools to bring advanced ideas to life. For me, it’s more than just learning — it’s another step toward turning machine learning research into products and solutions that matter.
My goal is clear: I want to create innovative ML projects at the international level. I believe that participating in SMILES-2025 is not just an opportunity, but a turning point — where I can absorb practical knowledge from global experts and apply it in new, meaningful ways. I’ve studied your program, and I’m especially excited by the practical seminars and exposure to cross-cultural collaboration in [country name] — these are exactly the kinds of experiences I need to move forward.
If you invest in me — through the knowledge and mentorship offered at SMILES — I will convert that investment into real-world innovation. I don’t just want to study ML; I want to push it forward.
Thank you for considering my application. I’m ready to learn, build, and collaborate — and I can’t wait to be part of the SMILES-2025 community.
Sincerely,
[name]
