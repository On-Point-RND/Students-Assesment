Dear [name],
I believe that participating in SMILES-2025 represents a unique opportunity to deepen my understanding of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), while advancing my career aspirations in [field].
Today, there are many scientific instruments, such as [compaany] and [compaany], that provide huge amounts of data with high spatial and temporal resolution. This opens up new opportunities for studying the [celestial body] and near-Earth space, but also requires new approaches in processing such volumes of data. Therefore, a modern scientist must be able to use and adapt new advances in machine and deep learning to their needs.
Iâ€™m a researcher in [compaany]. Last year I joined a new lab of intellectual data analysis where I am working on forecasting solar activity indices using machine and deep learning methods. During this time, several models for time series forecasting were studied and tested.
Subsequently, a combination of a variational mode decomposition algorithm and a modern deep learning model TiDE was applied, which gave a noticeable improvement in the accuracy of index forecasting compared to the models presented in the articles of other authors. This work has been accepted to publication in Acta Astronautica (Q1).
In addition, as part of the work with colleagues from a neighboring department, a model for classifying the quality of images from the [facility] (a new scientific facility created by the [compaany] as part of a Megaproject) was developed and trained. For this, the primary data labeling was carried out using the Clip model, then the dataset was verified manually and prepared for tuning the EfficientNet model. Next, to improve the classification accuracy, a gradient boosting CatBoost model was used, to the input of which the embeddings obtained in the previous model were fed. This approach allowed us to increase the forecast accuracy to 97% on the test sample.
From this summer school, I aim to develop a deep understanding of modern ML/DL frameworks and their applications across various fields. I hope to master advanced techniques like transformers, graph neural networks, and attention mechanisms, which are highly promising for solving complex astrophysics problems. Additionally, I look forward to enhancing my practical skills through hands-on workhops and projects that mirror real-world challenges. Engaging with experts and building collaborative networks will be invaluable for exchanging knowledge and driving innovation. Lastly, I aspire to stay informed about the latest trends in AI and ML, especially those impacting space science and technology.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to contributing and benefiting from this exceptional educational experience.
Kind regards,
