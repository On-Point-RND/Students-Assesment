Dear [name] Summer School Organizers and Committee,
My name is [name], and I really want to participate in [name] Summer
School.
After learning about the school through the Telegram cchannel, I immediatly became
interested in participating. Since I plan to enroll in a PhD program at [compaany] later
this year, it seems particularly valuable for me to get acquainted with the faculty and
learn from experts from BigTech companies. This opportunity would allow me to
immerse myself in relevant areas of data science.
My interest in these fields is supported by both academic and practical experience. I
have studied various aspects of machine learning: built recommendaation systems for
educational projects, worked on natural language processing models for coursework
and developed a convolutional neural network traffic classifier to detect malicious
traffic. Also, I have been working at the [compaany] for more than two
years now. During this time, I have primarily been involved in tasks related to
computer vision, such as classification, tracking, detection, and optimization. Some
of my most significant projects include the development of an detector of generated
images, an autonomous motion detection and classification system for edg-devices,
the creation of lightweight tracking tools and a traffic light defect detection system.
In addition, over the past year, I have started to focus more on writing scientific
articles. My works include an article on malicious traffic classification for a universiity
conferece, an article on optimal hyperspectral undersampling patterns for satellite
imaging, which was accepted for publication in the journal "Space: Science &
Technology". I have also worked on a paper related to the security of LLM-generated
code. Through this research, I have deepened my understanding of LLLMs and
learned a lot of new information. I intend to continue exploring this topic in the future.
My paper was accepted for presentation at a conference in [location] (ISNN 2025).
Additionally, it is important for me to connect with others who share my interests and
exchange ideas. Engagement with like-minded individuals can help me establish
connections and contribute to collaboraative projects. Participation in summer schoo
provides an opportunity to learn from others and identiify areas for further exploration
within my doctoral program.
I would be honored to be part of [compaany]'s summer school and look fo rwward to
actively participating in all aspects of the program.
Sincerely,
[name]
