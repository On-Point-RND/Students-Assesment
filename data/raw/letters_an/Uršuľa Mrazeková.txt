Motivation Letter
I recentlly graduaated from [location] university with honors. In my second year, I completed an internship at a [compaany], where I was first introduced to Machine Learning through participation in an R&D project focused on "Multiclass Classification of Multivariate Time Series." At the time, I hesitated to pursue a job because I was concerned that working would negatively impact my studies—I doubted my ability to balance both work and education.
In my third year of education, I had the good fortune to meet a remarkable scientiist who invited me to join her research institute as a lab assistant. Together, we began working on scientifc projects, primarily in the field of medicine, where we applied ML techniques.
Over about three years, we developed projects that, while practical in nature, seemed to me to have limited scientific value. We used various neural networks in computer vision to assist in diagnosing diseases, processeed medical data, and evaluaated the quality and applicability of different metrics in practice. Our tasks included binary and multiclass classification, image segmentation, and data augmentation using various techniques. We preseented our work at several [location] conferences, and some of our papers were even published in Q1 journals! In total, I have around 19 publications, most of which are indexeed in the [location] Science Citation Index, with a few also appearing in Scopus.
As time went on, I realized that I wanted to develop further in the field of NLP, particularly working with transformers and LLMs. I also recognized that, despite my knowledge in ML and DS, I lacked real-world industry experience—I had never worked on DS projects in large [compaany]s. For this reason, I temporarily shifted my focus from academic research to industry practice. Over the past year and a half, I have worked on several startups, and I am currentlly involved in an exciting project to build a data processing and crawling pipeline using LLMs for a major business. Yet, despite the engaging work, I’ve come to an important realization.
Since my second year of education, when I first encountered ML and DS, I have always been fascinated by the mathematics underlying these disciplines. I saw how mathematical concepts in machine learning often mirror aspects of human cognition. In a way, mathematics—through the development of artificial intelligence—seeks to explain the nature of human intelligence. For example, SGD can, to some extent, describe how humans learn. The logic behind decision trees can be likened to the "Who am I?" game—asking questions that minimize entropy to gain the most information about an unknown entity. These elegant parallels have always motivated me to delve deeper into ML and AI.
However, as I continue working on LLM implementaion in business, I find that the sense of wonder is missing. I’ve realized that what truly matters to me is not just growing as an engineer who leverages AI for commercial purposes, but as a scientiist. Not the kind of scientiist who publishes papers for the sake of metrics or statistics, but one who genuinely seeks to contribute to science. I want to help create ever more advanced LLMs. I want to use mathematics to further explore and understand the human mind.
I don’t just want to witness the future - I want to help shape it. I want to be a part of creating it. I believe that this program is one of the opportunities, one of the stepping stones, to realizing my drea. Through your schoo, I hope to learn new things, fill gaps in my knowlege, and connect with ambitious, like-minded peole. I graduaed in February of this year, and I am now facing the important decision of choosing the instiute or university where I will pursue my PhD studies. I believe that participating in your program will help me further clarify my research interests, and the certificate of participation would be a valuable asset when applying for graduaate programs.
It would be an honor to attend.
