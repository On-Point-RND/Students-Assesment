Dear [name] Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in participating in the SMILES machine learning school. As a first-year Master’s student in Engineering Systems at [location],
my research and professional experiences align closely with the school’s focus on
cutting-edge AI methodologies, particularly efficient learning of large language models
(LLMs) and topological data analysis (TDA). The opportunity to engage with renowned
experts like [name], [name], and [name]—whose work bridges
theoretical AI with real-world applications—is a compelling motivator for my application.
Academic and Research Alignment
Under the guidance of Professor [name] at [location], I am currently
developing transformer-based architectures to classify movement patterns in stroke patients
for motor recovery applications. This work involves adapting models like
LIMU-BERT—originally designed for multivariate time-series data from IMU/sEMG
sensors—to operate efficiently on resource-constrained devices through quantization and
distillation. My hands-on experience with neurophensiological data, coupled with my
coursework in neuroimaging and reinforcement learning, fuels my ambition to explore
AI-driven solutions for medical robotics and brain-machine interfaces.
The SMILES school’s emphasis on topological data analysis resonates deeply with
my recent project on persistence homology for protein language models. By vectorizing
barcode derived from amino-acid sequences using persistence landscapes and training
classifiers with PyBoost and SVM, I demonstrated how TDA can enhance interpretability in
biological ML systems. Attending lectures by [name], a pioneer in topological
methods, would provide invaluable insights to advance this work.
Technical Expertise and Practical Skills
My professional background further equips me to contribute meaningfully to the
SMILE community:
Machine Learning Engineering: Optimized graph neural networks
(Spektral/TensorFlow) for disease spread prediction and designed RAG systems for DNA
sequence harmonization using FAI SS and BM25.
Software Development: Built secure APIs with Spring Boot/JWT and PDF processing
tools, ensuring scalable and robust ML pipelines.
Hardware Integration: Programmed ROS2-based navigation systems for robotics
competitions and soldered custom sensor circuits for real-time data acquisition.
These experiences reflect my ability to bridge theoretical concepts with engineering
pragmatism—a skill I aim to refine through SMILES’ interdisciplinary curriculum.
Global and Collaborative Readiness
Having completed an exchange semester at [location] and holding IELTS 7.5
(C1 English) and D A LF C1 French certifications, I thrive in multicultural academic
environments. My HSK3-level Chinese further positions me to engage productively during
the school’s residency in China.
Future Goals
Post-graduation, I intend to pursue a PhD focused on AI in neuroprosthetics,
integrating reinforcement learning for surgical robotics and topological analysis of neural
data. The SMILES school’s workshops on efficient LLM training and advanced TDA
techniques will directly support this vision, offering tools to optimize model performance and
interpretability in medical contexts.
Why SMILES?
The school’s focus on innovation at the intersection of theory and practice mirrors my
own approach to research. Learning from [name] and [name] (Trustworthy
AI) would empower me to tackle challenges like real-time inference on edge devices and
robust feature extraction from noisy biomedical datasets.
Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to contribute my technical rigor
and collaborative spirit to the SMILES community while gaining transformative knowledge
to advance my research in AI-driven healthcare.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
