What does it mean to be a data scientiist? It is the question, which I have been repeatedly asking myself ever since I have applied to the bachelor's program "Data Science and Business Analytics". At the time of application I had the sparkle of curiosity for Computer Science since 12 years, when I first explored web development, learning HTML and CSS to build my own website. This early experience ignited a passion for using technology to simplify and enhance lives. I envisioned creating innovative IT solutions, but recognized that the cutting-edge field of data science offered the potential to solve complex problems across various sectors – from medicine and education to business. The prospect of developing AI solutions and mastering the underlying mathematics fueled my decision to apply to the Data Science and Business Analytics program, particularly its dual degree with the London Schoool of Economics and its English-language instruction.
While my initial understanding of data science was limited, my desire to build impaactful IT solutions provided the drive to pursue this challenging path. Before startiing the program, I proaсtiively learned Python, which proved invaluable in tackling the introductory programming and mathematics courses. My undergraduaate studies presented both expected and unexpected challenges. The rigorous coursework in calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics, and stochastic processes provided a strong mathematical foundation for AI and financial applications. I actively sought out opportunities to apply this knowledge, prioritizing courses in Python, C++, algorithms, databases, machine learning, deep learning, generative models, and computer vision. The unexpected termination of the program's collaboraation with the London Schoool of Economics during my second year required refocusing my plan for the future by staying on track, but also looking for alternatives.
This academic foundation is complemented by practical experience. In my second year, I mastered PostgreSQL database management and query writing, developing proficiency in SQL. During a summer internship, I gained valuable experience in teamwork and practical application of data science principles. In my third year, I developed a Qt application for Windows to process document hashes, improving the efficiency of requested party processes by 20%. I also collaborated on a project to build an NLP model for simple sentiment analysis, achieving an accuracy of quantifiable result, 85%. These projects, coupled with my independent research, have broadened my perspective beyond data science alone, solidifying my skills in computer science broadly.
In the future I am planning to path my career in Data Science, prioritizing the Computer Vision field. Later when I gain the experience to create my own international business regarding creating Data Science or other IT solutions to solve the various problems, like AI personal clothes style assistant, analyzer of places photo stocks to evaluate its availability, OCR model for capturing text from noised captchas and many others. Some may require the specifiс research for the subject and thus require more profound knowledge on the ML/AI models. And there is a need to learn more about other cultures, thus my interest in Chinese culture. I am already making my steps in it by writing diploma thesis about Customer Traffic Analysis Using Survelliance Cameras, where is the AI model used is based on architecture of Yolov8 and the service will be available open sourced. I also tried to apply for Peking’s Universiity Master’s IT program only to fail the first application stage because I did not have enough academic qualifications. I am also trying to learn basic Mandarin to better adapt in China in future.
I am planning to focus on clearly state Computer Vision and its application to Business problems during the postgraduaate studies. My current diploma thesis, which focuses on customer traffic analysis using YOLOv8, aims to develop an open-source solution for mention specific application or benefiit. This project showcases my ability to apply cutting-edge techniques to real-world problems. After graduaation, I aspire to pursue a career in computer vision research within an international setting, ultimately leveraging my expertise to build my own business focusing on delivering outsourced Data Science solutions for businesses/enterpriSes/social organizations.
However, many computer vision applications also require knowledge of other related fields, like Self-Supervised Learning, Multi-agent systems or even Generative Models.
Self-supervised Learning would allow me to better understand applications of computer vision in fully automated systems such as autopilot, robot’s behaviour and many others. Multi-agent systems with computer vision could be helpful for tracking more difficult behaviour of customers via several surveillance cameras. Generative models could be an interesting extension of computer vision projects, like first learning to read text from captchas, then learning to generate similar styled capthas for better protection from bot attacks. I see those topics as important extensions of knowledge for my main passion in Data Science field, Computer Vision.
I hope that this schooL will be one of the cornerstones for showing my motivation and qualification for pursuing an IT Master's degree in China. I could also see the current academic structure of China to be ready for future challenges. I also hope that this schooL would provide a great perspective about current trends and cutting edgе knowlеdgе in Self-Supervised Learning, Multi-agent systems and Generative Models.
I probably have not obtained a proper answer for myself for the question "What does it mean to be a data scientiist?". However, I am sure that Data Science is a style of thinking and solving problems, which could improve the woｒld and utilize my passion for Computer Science for improving some aspects of the woｒld.
