Motivation letter
My name is [name], and I am excited to apply for the SMILES conference.
As a first-year student in the AI360: ML Native program at [compaany] , I am
studying advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence. This conference
is a great opportunity for me to develop my skills and learn more about AI, which
matches my interests and studies perfectly.
In February, I took part in a project school organized by [compaany] and [compaany]. My
team, led by [name], worked on detecting hallucinations in large language
models (LLMs). I was happy to see [name] as one of the speakers at
SMILES because our project used his preprint, "Hallucination Detection in LLMs
via Topological Divergence on Attention Graphs."
This topic is very important because making LLMs more reliable will help people
use them in real-world applications. At SMILES, I hope to learn about the latest
developments, find collaboration opportunities, and improve our methods for
detecting hallucinations—a key challenge in AI today.
I have experience with several programming languages, especially Python, which
I use for most of my ML projects because of its many useful libraries.
For me, SMILES is not just about learning—it’s also about joining a community of leading AI researchers. I look forward to discussing important topics in LLM
development, sharing ideas, and maybe starting new projects. Additionally, the
fact that the conference is in [location] makes it even more exciting. I’ve always been
interested in Chinese culture and history, so this will be a great chance to grow
both professionally and personally.
I believe attending SMILES will help me move forward with my current projects,
and deepen my understanding of modern language models. Most of all, I’m eager
to meet other researchers, reconnect with friends, and build new partnerships.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to be part of this
event and learn from such an experienced group of people.
Best regards,
[name]
