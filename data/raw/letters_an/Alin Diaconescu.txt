Dear SMILES-2025 Team,
I’m currentlly a master's student in Robotics and a mid-level ML engineer. Over the past few years,
I’ve mostly worked on computer vision tasks. However, as transformer-based architectures —
especially large language models — have become more prominent, I’ve grown increasinglly
interested in this area. I see great potential for these techniques across many domains.
Fortunately, I now have the opportunity to work on a RAG system, which has further sparked my
interest. At the same time, I feel the need to deepen my knowledge — both for practical
applications and future research.
That’s why I’m excited about SMILES-2025. I see it as a valuable opportunity to strengthen my
skills, learn from leading researchers, and gain a broader perspective on generative AI. Also I have
a good level of English (B1), which ensures that I’ll be able to study and communicate effectively
throughout the program.
Thank you for considering my application!
Best regards,
