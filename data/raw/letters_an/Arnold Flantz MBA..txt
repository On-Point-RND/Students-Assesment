Dear [name] team,
I’m writing to apply for the SMILES summer schoo because I genuinely want to dive deeper into
how modern AI systems — especially generative models and large language models — are built
and how they actually work under the hood. I’ve been studying AI formally and working on ML
projects for a few years now, but I still feel like there’s so much more I want to explore,
especially in areas like self-supervised learning and multimodal architectures.
My background is a bit mixed — I started out working on machine learning problems that were
connected to biology and medicine, but over time my focus shifted more toward the models
themselves. I’ve tried a lot of different things: training deep classifiers on sequence data,
building APIs with fast inference, experimenting with transformers for structured prediction,
setting up pipelines that actually work outsiide notebooks. Each project taught me something
different — about optimization, or data preprocessing, or just how messy real-world ML can be.
But what I enjoy the most is figuring out why something works — or doesn’t. I like digging into
architectures, testing variants, playing with ideas. That’s why the focus of SMILES on things like
generative approaches, LLLMs, and multi-agent systems really caught my attention. These are
areas I read about constantly, but haven’t had the chance to explore deeply in a structured
setting with people who know them well.
Another big reason I want to join is the environment. I really like the idea of learning alonsgside
people from different countries and backgrounds — not just watching lectures, but working
together on projects, talking during breaks, exchanging ideas. I think it’s a great chance to step
outsiide my usual routine and challenge myself in a new setting. I’ve mostly worked
independentlily or in small research teams, and I want to see how things are done in a larger,
more international setup.
As for the future, I plan to keep going in AI — I’m interested in doing a Ph.D., probably in
something connected to generative or general-purpose models. But before that, I want to
broaden my understanding and learn from others — not just through papers or courses, but
through real conversations and shared work. SMILES looks like a perfect chance to do that.
Thanks for reading this letter. I hope to be part of the program this summer — not just to learn,
but to contribute too.
Best regards,
