Dear [name] Admissions Committee,
I am excited to apply for the Skoltech Machine Learning Summer School 2025, a program that aligns
perfectly with my professional aspirations to deepen my expertise in generative AI and contribute to its
transformative impact on industry. With 3.5 years of experience as a data scientist specializing in
classical machine learning, computer vision (CV), and natural language processing (NLP), I am eager to
engage with the school’s cutting-edge curriculum on large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems,
and self-learning methods. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements in
generative AI and their practical implementation in business workflows, and I believe SMILES-2025
offers the ideal environment to achieve this.
Motivation: Embracing the Generative AI Revolution
The rapid evolution of generative AI has reshaped how businesses approach problem-solving.
Traditional workflows—requiring manual development of complex models from scratch—are
increasingly being replaced by fine-tuned open-source LLMs, vision-language models (VLMs), and few-
shot prompting techniques. At [company], where I currently develop NLP and CV models to enhance
marketplace trust and safety, I’ve witnessed firsthand how leveraging pre-trained models like
Transformers accelerates deployment while maintaining high accuracy. However, to fully unlock their
potential, I need a deeper understanding of the internal mechanics of state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative
architectures, such as optimization strategies, multimodal fusion, and safety frameworks.
SMILES-2025’s focus on generative methods, self-learning techniques, and Safe AI directly addresses
these gaps in my knowledge. The school’s workshops and hackathons will provide hands-on experience
in adapting these technologies to real-world scenarios, while collaborations with peers from [location] and
[location] will expose me to diverse perspectives on AI challenges. Additionally, the program’s emphasis on
international cooperation resonates with my belief that cross-border knowledge exchange is critical to
advancing ethical and scalable AI solutions.
Relevant Experience: From AutoML to Generative Models
My career has equipped me with a robust foundation in deploying machine learning systems across
industries, from finance to e-commerce. Below are highlights of my work that demonstrate my
readiness for SMILES-2025’s advanced curriculum:
1. Generative AI in Practice
o At [company], I improved user safety by developing NLP and CV models to detect
fraudulent actions. Several tasks included fine-tuning open-source LLMs and VLMs. This
experience solidified my belief in generative AI’s potential but also revealed my need to
master advanced topics like prompt engineering and multimodal agent systems.
o At [company], I designed a hybrid Vision Transformer (ViT) and Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) model for car damage detection, achieving a 15% accuracy boost over traditional
CNNs. This project underscored the value of combining generative and discriminative
approaches—a concept I aim to explore further during the school’s sessions on
multimodal AI.
2. Building Scalable ML Systems
o At [company], I led the development of AutoML Baseline (AMELIA), a service automating
data collection and processing, model training on tabular data and deployment. By
integrating SOTA tabular neural networks and orchestrating pipelines via [company], the
tool reduced model development time by 70% for data scientists, analysts and risk
managers.
o For sequential data (e.g., transaction histories), I contributed to AutoDL Service (ANNA),
optimizing architectures using LSTM and Transformer-based models. My work on model
compression and code optimization for this service aligns with SMILES-2025’s focus on
efficient self-learning methods.
3. Advancing the ML Community
o I authored a Habr article on AutoML best practices and presented at DataTalks and MTS
True Tech conferences, advocating for democratized AI tools. My open-source
contributions and teaching experience in the “AutoML in Practice” course
(OpeneDAtaScience) reflect my commitment to knowledge sharing—a value central to
SMILES-2025’s mission.
Expectations from SMILES-2025
I see SMILES-2025 as a unique opportunity to:
1. Dive Deep into Generative Architectures: Gain hands-on experience with LLM fine-tuning,
agent-based systems, and multimodal fusion techniques. I am particularly interested in
workshops that explore the trade-offs between model performance, computational efficiency,
and ethical constraints.
2. Solve Industry-Relevant Problems: The hackathons will allow me to test generative approaches
on real-world datasets, such as automating customer support with LLMs or enhancing fraud
detection through multimodal analysis.
3. Learn from Global Experts: Engaging with faculty and peers from Skoltech and Harbin Institute
of Technology will broaden my understanding of regional AI challenges and foster collaborations
for future projects.
4. Explore Safe AI Frameworks: As businesses increasingly adopt generative AI, ensuring
robustness and fairness becomes critical. I aim to study techniques for bias mitigation and
model interpretability discussed in the school’s sessions.
Career Vision: Bridging Innovation and Impact
In the next five years, I plan to lead AI innovation teams that integrate generative technologies into
business pipelines. SMILES-2025’s training will equip me with the technical depth and global network
needed to drive such initiatives. Long-term, I aspire to establish a research lab focused on ethical AI,
collaborating with international partners to create standards for Safe AI deployment.
Conclusion
My blend of industry experience, technical skills, and passion for generative AI makes me a strong
candidate for SMILES-2025. I am eager to contribute to the school’s collaborative environment while
gaining the expertise required to pioneer next-generation AI solutions. Thank you for considering my
application.
