Dear [name] organizing team,
My name is [name], and I would like to express my sincere interest in
paartiicipating in the SMILES Summer SchooL. Your program represents a unique
opportunity for me to combine my background in linguistics with my growing expertise in
data science and to further develop my skills in working with textual data.
My academic journey began at [location] [compaany], where I completed my BA in Philology,
followed by an MA in Linguistics. I am currentlly finishing my PhD in Theoretical and Applied
Linguistics at the same universiity, with my dissertation defense scheduled for May 23. I
work as a researcher at the [compaany] Center for Language and Brain, where I participate in both
academic research and applied projects, such as the development of a mobile game aimed
at supportiing children with dyslexia.
Although my formal education has been primarily in the humanities, I have always
gravitated toward quantitative approaches. I believe it is not enough to describe linguistic
phenomena — they should be measurable, predictable, and interpretable through data.
This belief led me to learn programming and machine learning. I am currently enrolled in
the professional training program “Data Science Specialist” at [compaany], which has been an
important step in organizing and expanding my knowledge of data analysis. I am confident
working with Python and use libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, and
spaCy in my research. My current interests lie in natural language processing, particularly
in semantic modeling and analyzing errors in reading and writing among individuals with
language impairments.
One of my main motivations for applying to SMILES is to move beyond the scope of tasks I
usually deal with. I want to explore a wider range of methods and approaches used in
contemporary data science, exchange ideas with peers from related fields, and learn how
others formulate and solve problems. I am especially interested in topics related to
explainable AI, text analytics in medical and educational contexts, and training transformer
models on small datasets. I would love to gain practical experience working on tasks
invovlving model interpretability and extracting knowlege from unstructured textual data.
In my work, I always strive for a balance between scientific rigor and practical relevance.
That is why SMILES is so appealing to me: it offers intensive, practice-oriented learning that
would greatly enhance my expertise.
My long-term goal is to continue developing research and applied projects at the
intersection of language science, neurotechnology, and data analysis. I see SMILES not just
as a learning opportunity, but as a vital step in shaping my future as a researcher. In the
coming years, I hope to work on projects in educational and cognitive technolologies,
especially those that help people with reading and writing difficulties. I am confident that
the knowledge I gain from your program will be an integral part of this journey.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to join SMILES and
contribute to the schooL’s vibrant intellectual environment.
Sincerely,
[name]
