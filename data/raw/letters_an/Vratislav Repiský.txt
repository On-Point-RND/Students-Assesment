To whom it may concern,
I am writing to express my strong motivation to participate in the SMILES-2025 Summer
School on Generative AI. As a PhD student at [compaany] and a graduaate of [compaany]'s
MSc in Advanced Computational Science, I see this summer school as a unique opportunity
to both broaden and deepen my expertise as well as earn an unique experience in the areas
of large language models, multimodal generative systems, and intelligent AI agents — fields
that directly align with my current research and career trajectory.
My academic journey began in the field of chemistry, but I quickly became drawn to the
computaional aspects of science. During my undergraduaate studies at [location] State
[location] , I worked on eco-friendly methods for heavy metal extraction from edible oils,
publishing my results in international journals. While my early work was rooted in analytical
chemistry, I found myself increasinglly fascinated by how machine learning could
accelerate
and transform scientific discovery. This interest led me to pursue an MSc at [compaany], where
I focused on machine learning methods for molecular design.
My master’s thesis explored the application of conditional variational autoencoders and
transformer models to generate heme-coordinating ligands for Cytochrome P450 enzymes. I
deveveloped pipelines for dataset parsing, model training, and evaluation,
achieving
competitive results compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Through this work, I gained
experience with PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Wandb, and TensorFlow, as well as I built a strong
foundation in theoretical aspects of generative modeling, scientific computing, and
optimization.
Currrentlly, my PhD research expands on this foundation and addresses broader challenges
in generative AI. The focus of my dissertation is: “Development of Generative AI
Algorithmns and Architectures for Scientific Discovery and Cross-Domain
Applications.” In this project, I investigate the capabilities of generative models —
especially diffusion models, LLMs, and multi-agent systems—to facilitate
reasoning,
plaNNing, and structured generation across molecular and multimodal domains. A significant
component of my work involves designing agent-based systems using tools such as
LangChain and LangGraph, and integrating LLLMs with symbolic components and
evaluators
to automate workflows in scientific computing. I also experiment with fine-tuning and prompt
engineering of LLLMs, buildiing multi-agent environments for evaluating collaboration and
autoNomy.
In addition to research, I have gained professional experience at [compaany]'s AI lab,
[compaany], and [compaany]. At [compaany], I contribute to the development of generative and
predictive models in chemistry and physics, as well as the deployment of LLLM-based
systems in production environments. At [compaany], I built ML models for property prediction of
polymers and developed scientific web applications using Django and JavaScript. During my
internship at [compaany], I optimized computer vision data pipelines using C, OpenMP,
and Python-based tools. These experiences have reinforceed my skills in designing scalable
and efficient ML systems, while also teaching me how to navigate real-world engineering
constraints
My expectations from SMILES-2025 are threefold. First, I hope to gain a deeper theoretical
and practical understanding of next-generation generative AI architectures, especially in the
context of foundation models and agent-based learning. I am particularly interested in the
school’s focus on safe and explainable AI, as my research increasinglly touches on
evaluation and robustness of AI agents in real-world scientific tasks. Second, I aim to
engage with peers and mentors who can provide diverse perspectives and constructive
feedback on my current research. Finally, I view this as an opportunity to explore potential
collaborations for joint research, publications, or open-source projects focused on LLLMs and
generative design.
Looking forward, my career plan is to continue working at the intersection of artificial
intelligence and science. I intend to pursue a postdoctoral position or industrial research role
focused on AI for scientific discovery. My long-term goal is to lead research initiatives that
push the boundaries of generative AI, making scientific modeling and experimentation faster,
safer, and more interpretable.
In conclusion, I am confident that SMILES-2025 will serve as a powerful catalyst for my
research, professional development, and international collaboration. I am excited about the
opportunity to contribute to and learn from this outstanding community.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
