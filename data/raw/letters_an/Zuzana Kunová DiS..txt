My name is [name] [surname], and I am a first-year PhD student at the Chemistry Department of [location]. Since my first year of education, I worked as a laboratory assistant in the "Functional Organic Compounds" laboratory (headed by Prof. [surname]) at the [compaany] of Organic Chemistry of the [location] Academy of Sciences. However, I decided to continue my postgraduate studies in the "Theoretical Chemistry" laboratory (headed by Prof. [surname]). My research has resulted in seven scientific publications in international journals, with two more currently under review. My recent work focuses on applying a hybrid approach (combining machine learning and quantum chemistry) to create a universal tool for predicting optical spectra of complex organometallic compounds.
Having been immersed in the [location] chemical science system, I have observed how the research process is structured. The approaches currently used in organic chemistry remain at an "alchemy" level, and it is quite difficult to change the thinking vector of the vast majority of institute employees. In my view, fundamental science needs to incorporate data analysis, which will help produce truly valuable discoveries. Currently, I also work at [compaany] as a ML Engineer, where I reduce time to market by applying machine learning algorithms for accelerated selection of components for future products based on brand manager requirements.
I began studying machine learning and statistics in-depth in early 2021, before the "media boom" of neural networks. In early 2023, I enrolled in the "Neural Networks in Scientific Research" course from the [compaany] Foundation and won first place in their scientific research competition with the topic: "Prediction of photo-dynamic properties of organoelement compounds using machine learning methods." Additionally, I participated in the "SMILES 2023" school, contributing to work on large language models in chemistry with [name] [surname]. At the "SMILES 2024" school, I worked with the [name] Lab team on a project using contrastive learning for multimodal user segmentation.
In parallel, I continued my work at the Research Institute to enhance my competencies in organic chemistry and theoretical chemistry. I studied photoredo reactions, which are processes that utilize visible light energy to initiate chemical reactions. Currently, this is a rapidly developing field with limited research dedicated to the design and creation of catalysts with specific parameters. Since 2022, the chemistry community has turned its attention to this problem, leading to active publication of works on this topic.
The challenge of rational catalyst design is particularly acute in all areas of chemistry. Using machine learning algorithms, I developed a model capable of predicting photophysical properties such as the absorption wavelength, excited state lifetime, and quantum yield based on compound structure. I plan to further develop this project to enable users to create new catalysts based on their specific requirements using a diffusion neural network. To complete this project and create a comprehensive service for selecting and generating new photocatalysts, I need to gain experience and new knowledge from professionals in the field of machine learning. This is precisely why I want to participate in the "SMILES 2025" summer school.
