Dear organizers,
My name is [name] and I am applying for the SMILES-2025 Summer School of Machine Learning. I am finiishing my master’s degree in Advanced Computational Science at [location] and working as a junior research engineer at [compaany]’s Artificial Intelligence Center, focusing on 3D reconstructiontasks.Participating in the school is an opportunity to explore generative models further and apply them to my field. I am particularly interested in the generative design of 3D objects, a promising field that is finding its application in the construction industry.
My journey in machine learning started with basic science. I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Supercomputer Technology in Engineering and Physical Modeling at [location], where I studied computational fluid dynamics and parallel computing. My academic background is mathematical analysis, linear algebra, probability theory and advanced courses in theoretical physics, while the technical stack includes Fortran, C, C++, Python, OpenMP and MPI. Upon completion of my undergraduate degree, I chose [location]’s Advanced Computational Science master’s program to continue my studies, where I delved into Software Engineering, Numerical Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Parallel Computing on CUDA, and Perception in Robotics. I practiced my skills in group projects:
• Deploying a smart calculator (C, Docker, gtest, Makefile)
• MRI Tumor Segmentation and Classification (PyTorch, EfficientNet, U-Net, ResNet)
• Synthetic Speech Detection (PyTorch, transformers, ResNet)
• IMU Attitude Estimation (python, Kalman, Madgwick, Particle Filters)
I also participated in AIRIxMTUCI’s SafeSpeak-2024 hackathon on deepfake detection for secure voice communications, my team placed 4th overall. Additionally, I independently took a semester-long Computer Vision course from the School of Data Analysis by Yandex (SHAD) where I learned the basics of image processing (demosaicking, compression, distortion recovery) and neural network architectures(FCNN,CNN,Transformer,GAN).This knowledge served as a transition to modern AI, and I started researching approaches to 3D reconstruction.
The 3D reconstruction domain deals with the task of reconstructing the 3D structure of a scene from a set of RGB images and/or sensor (low-quality) depth maps. Traditional 3D reconstruction algorithms are based on the photometric properties of images and geometric constraints. However, in recent years, neural network-based learning algorithms have been more commonly used for 3D reconstructiontasks.In my work, I investigate both traditional approaches(e.g.COLMAP)and neural network algorithms, in particular, I am working on a multi-view RGB-D 3D surface reconstruction task, which takes multi-view RGB views and corresponding sensor depths as input and produces high-quality depth maps, which are used to form 3D data structure (point cloud or mesh). Recently, generative models (VAE, GAN, Diffusion) are gaining popularity and are used to create new objects.
I was interested in this area as the generation of 3D objects, specifically CAD models, which are ubiquitousin thedesignofstructuresintheconstructionfield.CADgenerationmethodsdarerepresented in the scientific community: from sketch generation for the final model (ExtrudeNet, Point2Cyl) to transformer/diffusion approaches (CAD-SIGNet, Draw Step by Step).
At [compaany]’s Artificial Intelligence Center, I want to be involved in 3D design, combining research workon the development of new methods with applied tasks of implementing these technologiesin the construction industry, which will significantly accelerate the design process and improve its accuracy.
Participation in SMILES-2025 will allow me to learn more about modern approaches in the field of generative intelligence, gain practical experience working with generative algorithms in collaboration with leading experts and talented researchers, and expand the professional community. I am confident that the knowledge and experience gained at the school will be an important step in my research at the intersection of 3D reconstruction and generative modeling, opening new perspectives for both academic work and industrial applications.
I look forward to participating in the summer school and grateful for the opportunity to apply!
Sincerely,
