MY MOTIVATION FOR PArticipation
In the dynamically developing world of modern technologies, more and more attention is
paid to convenience and automation of processes. I have been working in an oil compaany
since 2017 and there are things that I would like to improve. Recently, I became interested
in the topic of applying artificial intelligence in the oil and gas industry. Large companies
lack innovative research and new approaches to work. There are many areas for optimizing
standard processes and applying AI. For example, a chatbot capable of providing the user
with information about fields and the current state of development would be useful. Many
oil companies are faced with the problem of the lack of a single standard for the data
received and stored, as well as the lack of a single “reference book” that could provide an
answer to the question. There are examples of large companies that have benefiited greatly
from cleaning up their data warehouse and implementing a virtual assistant.
My career as a geomechanics specialist has reached a dead end at the moment. I am looking
for new areas for development and opportunities. I would be glad to participate in a cool
project.
I want to participate in the Summer SchooL of Machine Learning. I want to study current
technologies. I believe that this will help expand my knowledge and improve my skills. In
addition, I really want to visit [location]. Exchange experiences with foreign colleagues. I have
higher expectations from this intensive course on AI methods.
