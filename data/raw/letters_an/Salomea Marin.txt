My name is [name] and I am a third-year student in the Faculty of Computer Science at [location], currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.
Since the eleventh grade, I have been fascinated by artificial intelligence and its applications in everyday life. I have completed several machine-learning courses most notably the Deep Learning School at [compaany] and ML exercises at [compaany] and recently I have become particularly interested in generative AI and large language models. I enjoy reading about the latest advances in the field and delving into the mathematics behind complex architectures of models. Furthermore, I have always wanted to participate in an international conference or summer school, as such experiences provide both motivation and invaluable opportunities to learn from leading experts.
To date, I have undertaken a variety of academic projects: a transformer-based model for German-to-English translation, an image-classification system, a denoisinng diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for generating celebrity faces and an AI chatbot on Telegram that emulates human conversation. I am now finalizing my first research paper, which proposes a reinforcement-learning trading strategy trained on synthetically generated data using RNN and TCN-GAN architectures. Over the last semester, I developed a strong interest in transformers and LLLMs particularly how they can tackle diverse tasks from image editing to writing and executing code and I am pursuing independent research in this area.
In my program, we choose one of several specializations, including ML. I knew from my first-year linear algebra lab when we wrote a simple neural network to classify diamonds and competed for the lowest mean squared error that ML was my passion. I vividly remember staying up late, experimenting to improve our model and carefully avoiding overfitting. Since then, I have entered several Kaggle competitions, although limited GPU resources and a heavy course load have constrained my results, they have also fueled my determination to learn and develop my skills.
As a third-year student, I bring both solid technical knowledge and a fresh perspective that I believe will enrich our discussions and collaborations with international colleagues at school. Having led multiple self-initiated team projects, I am skilled at task distribution, idea generation and problem-solving in group settings. I am confident that, in a hackathon environment, my teammates and I will conceive and implement innovative solutions that in the future might bring benefit to humanity.
I expect this summer school to connect me with an international community of ML enthusiasts and to offer hands-on hackathon experience. I look forward to forging new professional relationships—people with whom I can collaborate on research projects, exchange ideas and seek advice. I believe that the in-person format will foster continuous interaction, creating the most productive environment for learning and growth.
This year, I plan to submit my article to the [conference] conference and to identify the deep-learning subfield that most captivates me. I am committed to making the most out of my time at [location] by completing courses with top grades especially in ML/DL courses and then focusing on a single research area. My goal is to join a laboratory at [location] to conduct experiments or secure an internship at [compaany] to advance my practical experience. I believe this summer school will give me the boost I need to achieve these goals quickly.
Thank you for considering my application. I am eager for the opportunity to contribute to and learn from this program.
