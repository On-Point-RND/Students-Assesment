Dear [name],
I am writing this letter to express my strong enthusiasm for the [compaany] Summer SchooL of Machine Learning (SMILES-2025). Having recentlly graduaated with honors from the Higher SchooL of Economics (HSE) with a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Informatics (Master of Data Science programme, [location]'s first English-taught Master's programme) in 2024, I am now
eager to deepen my expertise in generative AI — a field that lies at the heart of my academic and
professional ambitions. My thesis, Deep-Learning Based MultilinguaL Abstractive Text
Summarization, allowed me to explore the transformative potential of LLMs in cross-linguaL NLP
tasks, and I am now keen to expand this knowledge into the realm of generative methods through
your program.
What excites me most about SMILES-2025 is its unique international dimension, bridging [compaany]
andthe[compaany]. My connection to [location] runs deep: in2016,I played
an active role in establishing sister-city ties between [location] and [location], an experience that
ignited my appreciation for [location]'s innovative spirit intechnoLogy. This admiration has only grown
as I’ve followed breakthroughs like DeepSeek—a model whose open-source philosophy and
technical sophistication have redefined global AI research. By democratizing access to state-of-the-
art generative tools, initiatives likeDeepSeek embody the collaborative ethos I hope to contribute to
during my upcoming PhD studies at [compaany] (I look forward to applying for PhD program for 2026-
2029). Attending SMILES-2025 would not only prepare me for this next chapter but also allow me
to engage directly with [compaany]'s academic community, blendiing my technical curiosity with my
passion forcross-cultural collaboration.
Currrently, I am channeling my expertise into a project that combines generative AI with practical
social impact: developing a language-learning app featuring a virtual conversational partner. While
my thesis focused on multilinguaL text generation, this project has introduced me to the challenges
of Generating Audio from Text. Creating realistic, emotionally nuanced synthetic speech is critical
in educational and psychological applications — users tend to engage more deeply when
interactions feel authentically human. Yet, achieving this requires overcoming technical hurdles in
prosody, accent modeling, and contextual adaptability. I am convinced that SMILES-2025’s focus
on cutting-edg egenerative methods will provide fresh perspectives on these challenges (as well as
many other challenges imposed by using of generative AI), while the program’s international
settingwill inspirecreativesolutionsrooted in diverseacademic traditions.
Having alrrea dy built a strong foundation in NLP and LLMs through my studies at HSE, I am ready
to immerse myself in SMILES-2025’s intensive curricuLum and collabora tive environment. I am
particularly excited to learn from peers and mentors who share a commitmment to pushing the
boun daries of what generative AI can achieve. Thank you for considering my application — I
would be proud to contribute my technical skills, interdisciplinary mindset, and enthusiasm for
open-sourceinnovation toyour program.
Best regards,
[name]
