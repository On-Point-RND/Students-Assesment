To Whom It May Concern,
I am excited to apply for the Skoltech Summer of Machine Learning (SMILES) Program, particularly given this year’s collaboration with [compaany]. The program’s emphasis on large language models, multimodal systems, and self-learning methods directly intersects with my research interests and long-term goals. Also, as someone deeply inspired by [compaany]’s research, I view this program as an invaluable opportunity to grow as an AI researcher and take a step closer to my dream of joining this research institution.
My primary research focus lies in modern retrieval and candidate generation techniques for recommender systems, especially those leveraging large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. While my background began in NLP, I quickly discovered that many of the most exciting challenges (e.g. dynamic user modeling, session-based recommendations, cold-start problems) can be addressed through hybrid retrieval-generation architectures.
Currently, at [compaany], I work on improving recommendation pipelines by experimenting with generative candidate generation (sequence-to-sequence approaches) and multi-modal content embeddings. However, I recognize that advancing in this field requires deeper mathematical foundations — an area I am actively strengthening through self-study and coursework. While I am still early in my journey toward fundamental research, I am highly motivated, and I believe SMILES can significantly accelerate my development.
What draws me most to SMILES is its structured approach to both theory and application. While recommender systems fall outside this year’s SMILES curriculum, I believe that core concepts translate across domains. For instance, understanding the theoretical guarantees of self-supervised learning or the trade-offs in multi-agent systems would directly inform my work on robust recommender architectures. I also hope to explore how [compaany]’s research in LLM alignment and efficiency could translate to recommendation tasks, such as mitigating hallucination in generative recommenders or improving inference scalability.
Beyond technical growth, SMILES offers a unique opportunity to collaborate with peers and mentors who share my enthusiasm for AI’s interdisciplinary potential. The program’s international dimension is particularly appealing, as I believe diverse perspectives are essential for tackling complex problems like ethical AI or cross-domain generalization.
Moreover, as someone interested in education, I hope to gain insights that I can later share with my students to promote machine learning amongst younger generation.
Speaking about career goals, I aspire to contribute to fundamental research, particularly in retrieval-augmented generative models for recommendations, and plan to pursue a master’s degree at a leading institution like Skoltech, HSE, or MIPT, where I can deepen my expertise. I would also like to transition into a full-time research position at [compaany] or a similar institution. I am especially drawn to problems at the intersection of NLP and RecSys.
Thank you for considering my application.
Yours sincerely,
