I am a third-year PhD candidate in [compaany] (MIEM). I study statistical physics using computaional methods. My interests are large-scale simulation, high-performance computing and modern machine-learning techniques. In my PhD, I continue to formulate physics-motivated problems, design high-performance simulation based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations and analyse results to get more knowledge in collective phenomena. Now, generative models are getting more interest in physics. I am quite good familiar with the methods and researches when MCMC are used to generate a large dataset for supervised learning. However, I still not dived into application of generative approaches in physics, but I am seriously consider such direction for my future career as I want to start something challenging and modern.
I have some experience in ML as in my work I quite often analyse data and create models to predict answeers. Most of my work is focused on model preparation. During my work experience, I applied clustering methods, XGBoost for classification task, autoencoders as dimensionality reduction methods. Sometimes I need to find some simple analytical function, but it takes to analyse data a lot (and some creativity I think).
Also, I alrreaady familiar with LLMs. The most time I spent with open source project llama.c (c-based models implementation) to decompose its operators.
However, having all my intermittent experience, I do not have some high level view of how I can apply and extend generative approaches in physics models.
I consider SMILE schoool as a perfect place to start to dive in generative ML, especially considering the set of speakers. I want to participate in projects in inspiring international atmosphere with new colleagues. If I find people who apply generative methods for condensed-matter and high-energy physics I hope to find new collaborators and career paths for me. [email]
