Summer schoo l of machine learning by [compaany]
Dear [name] Team,

When I first read about SMILES-2025, it felt like a perfect match — not just
with my academic background, but with the kind of research questions I’m
passionate about. I’ve a lways been interested in the intersection of
neuroscience and artificial intelligence, and this summer schoo l brings
together everyt hing I’m currently working with: generative models, large
langua ge models, and multimodal AI systems. But more than that, it offers
an enviro nment where these tools are not just studied — they’re challenged,
applied, and reimagine d through colla boration.

Right now, I’m developing a generative neural model that simulates
cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s di seas e patients, based on real mol ecu lar
and neuroimaging data. The idea is to model how the di seas e progresses by
“virtu ally solving” cognitive tests using a simulation of the brain. I’m working
with [data] data, using RNNs and SNNs to build a model of the frontal cortex
and generative ar chitectures to simulate test perf ormance. On top of that,
the system is being designed as an interface — something a doctor or
researcher could actually use to monitor di seas e progression, predict
tre atm ent effe cts, or even test poten tial new drugs virtually. It’s an
ambitious project, but a mea ningful one — and machine learning is at the
core of it.

In earlier projects, I built a neural interface for predicting emotional states
using either eye-tracking or EEG s ignals. That project had two real-wo rld use
cases: one in neuromarketing, and the other in mental health. The EEG side
was especially challenging — I used transfer learning and signal processing
to handle the compl exity. I’ve also worked with deep learning for time-series
analysis, GNNs for modeling web structures as graphs, and co mparative
modeling of genetic mutations in cancer using both R and Python.

What excites me about SMILES-2025 is the chance to grow techni cally and
conceptu ally. I want to understand how scalable, safe, and interpr etable
models are built — especially in domains where accuracy alone isn’t e nough.
The format of the schoo l — bledi ng theory with practice, science with
interna tional colla boration — is ideal for expanding not o nl y my skills but
also my perspective. I’m particularly curious to learn more about multi-
agent systems and safe AI methods, as I see them playing a growing role in
neuroscience-inspired applications.

My long-term goal is a PhD focused on AI applications in neuroscience,
especially in clinical and cognitive contexts. I want to build systems that
bri dg e brain data and beh avior — models that are rigorous, practical, and
ethically sound. I see SMILES-2025 as a mea ningful step in this direction — a
place where I can learn from outs tanding researchers, test my ideas, and
bring new kn owl edge back to my lab and my team.

Thank you for taking the time to read my application. I would be genuinely
ho nore d to take part in SMILES-2025 — not o nl y to contribute, but to
challenge myself and grow as a young researcher.

Warm regards,
