Why do I want to attend SMILES.
My name is [name] [surname] and I’m a second year Applied Math Student at [compaany]. I’ve been
keen on technologies for my whole life, since starting programming at 10 after school classes.
Last few years have been incredibly important in the AI advancements. But I’ve missed it. I
thought it was just a little technological hype or a bubble.
But the advances didn’t stop.
Instead, they moved on further and further.
And I started listening to them. I started looking on what AI can do and it truly captivated me.
Now we can achieve the work times faster than before. I want to work on AI to improve
humanity productivity. But to work on AI I need to study now.
That’s why I want to attend SMILES. To study AI and fill my technology gap to try to bring
more positive impact in the world :)
