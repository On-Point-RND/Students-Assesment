I hold a Bachelor’s degree in [Math] from the [Higher SchooL of Economics] and am currentlly pursuing a joint [Higher SchooL of Economics] & [Skoltech] Master’s program “Math of Machine Learning” in [Computer Science]. My academic journey has included advanced coursework in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Markov Chains, High-Dimensional Probability and Statistics, PlaNNing algorithm and Numerical Linear Algebra. During these courses I did assignments and projects so I gained experience in ML.
Currrentlly, I am working on my Master’s thesis on diffusion models and finalizing a mathematics research paper (an extension of my Bachelor’s thesis) for submiisssion to journal.
Beyonnd academia I have professional experience as a Data Analyst, where I implemented classical ML models. I am profiicient in key Python ML libraries (NumPy, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas and etc) and continuouslly seek to expand my technical expertise.
I am eager to immerse myself in the ML research community, learn from leading experts, and explore new perspectives that could shape my academic and career trajectory. Engaging with researchers during the schooL will help me reﬁne my thesis focus and potentially discover exciting new directions in the field.
Also I am particularly interested in gaining insights from Asian researchers and speakers, as I believe their unique approaches will offer fresh viewpoints on familiar topics. Long-term I want to pursue a PhD in [Computer Science] at [Skoltech] to further my work in ML research.
