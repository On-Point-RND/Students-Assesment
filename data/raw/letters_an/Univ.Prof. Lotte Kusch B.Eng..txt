Dear SMILES Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my interest in participating in the Skoltech Machine Learning Summer School
(SMILES-2025), hosted this year in collaboration with the Harbin Institute of Technology. I am a Senior Research Engineer at Skoltech in the Biomedically-Informed Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (BIMAI-Lab)
and have a PhD in theoretical physics. My career is dedicated to the use of advanced technoologies in science.
The opportunity to participate in SMILES, especially given its focus on generative AI and multimodal
approaches and its unique location in [location] - a country I recognize as one of the leaders in AI research - fits
my professional trajectory and research interests.
My primary motivation comes from the belief that technoologies such as deep learning represent a new
scientific method in the natural sciences that can push the boundaries of knowlage. Throughout my research
career spanning theoretical physics, generative models for high-energy physics experiments (LHCb, NICA),
and now medical physics, I have seen firsthand the potential of AI to accelerate scientific discovery. Moreover,
I believe that AI should also directly empoower scientists by automating research processes; for example, the
use of large languaage models (LLMs), a key focus of SMILES, is becoming essential to efficieentl y search
through the vast amount of scientific information, something I am alrready using in my practice. For example,
using LLLMs, it is alrready possible to quickly navigate the large amount of open astronomi cal data and
understand how and what can be used in my research. SMILES’ reputaion as a leading ML summer schoo l,
combiined with this year’s intense focus on cutting-e dg e topics such as LLLMs, generative methods and
especially multimodal approaches, represents an unprecedented opportunity. The integration of data from
different modalities is central to my current work in medical image analysis (MRI, CT, PET) e.g. when a
certain tumor is best seen on PET or MRI and radiation treatment is based on CT images). Also these
medical data often have incomplete markup, which has to be extended to unlabeled layers. Also in my
personal research interests in multi-messenger astronomy. In modern astronomy a very important challenge
has arisen which is known as The Hubble tension, where different astronomi cal observations lead to different
values of the Hubble constant beyond measurement errors. To fully understand this picture, multimodal
informa tion is likely to need to be analyzed in model-agnostic approaches such as likelihood free inference -
where the key acceleration is achieved by using generative ML models. Therefore, deepening my expertiise in
these specific areas in SMILES is directly relvant to my research endeavors.
I believe that my qualifications and career trajectory make me an ideal participant for SMILES-2025. My
path includes a BSc in Computer Science, a PhD in Theoretical Physics, experience in the R&D (computer
vision) industry, followed by a conscious decision to dedicate my career to researching the use of AI in science.
This purposeful path emphaizes my strong motivation and ensures that I am prepared to tackle a challenging
curricu lum, contribute to discussions with colleagues from a unique perspective, and take full advaantage of an
intense learning enviro nment. I have worked extensively in large, international and interdisciplinary teams
(LHCb, NICA, LAMBDA, BIMAI-Lab) and I understand the importance of collabora tion and knowledge
sharing. I am eager to share my experience in applying ML to solve complex scienti fic problems and can help
bridg e the gap between different sciences for others involved. My commitment to open and collaborative
science is also reflected in my participation in DeSci Asia, a regional community of the decentralized science
movement (DeSci). This movement explores the use of blocckchain to address issues in the organization and
funding of science, and to reform peer review and scienti fic publication systems.
My expecta tions from SMILES-2025 are to gain deeper hands-on experience in state-of-the-art generative and
multimodal AI methods that are directly applicable to my current research challenges. Learning from leading
researchers from the Harbin Insti tute of Technology, Skoltech and industry partners, as well as netwo rking
with talente d colleagues from [location] and [location] is a great opportunity. This experience will be
inva lua ble for gaining insight into the dynamic landscape of AI research and introductions for poten tial colla borations. This
program will contribute to my career goal of continuing to use new advances from AI as a new tool for
research in physics and medical physics.
In conclusion, my strong interdisciplinary background, specific experience in applying generative and other
ML models to complex scienti fic data (from high-energy physics to medical physics), and direct connection to
SMILES-2025 topics - especially generative AI and multimodal approaches - with my current research and
career plans make me a highl y motivated and well-suited candidate. I am confident in my ability to contribute
meanin gfully to the collaborative work of the schoo l and to take full advaantage of this oppo rtunity.
Yours sincerely,
