Motivational Letter for SMILES-2025
Applicant: [name]
DearMembersoftheSMILES-2025SelectionCommittee,
My name is [name], and I am currently a final-year undergraduate student at the
Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics at [location], my speciality is
Programming Technologies. I’m excited about the opportunity to participate in the Skoltech
Summer School of Machine Learning.
As a research assistant at the National Center for Cognitive Development at [company], I
am currently contributing to a project focused on generating synthetic tabular
datasets. My current task is selecting meta-features that remain stable and reproducible in synthetic data, laying
the groundwork for integrating generative techniques – such as GANs and genetic algorithms
– to produce datasets with targeted statistical and structural properties. Our initial findings on
meta-feature selection were recently accepted for presentation at the Infernational Conference
onComputationalScience(ICCS).
My prior internship at [company]’s R&D center in [location] allowed me to perform
forecasting on spatio-temporal graphs using graph neural networks (GNNs). I developed architectures
that combine recurrent models with graph-based embeddings for forecasting time series
generated by systems with underlying graph structures, such as networks of cell towers. To effectively
evaluate these models, I also designed a tool for generating synthetic time series
data with spatial dependencies. This experience provided me with a lot of skills in neural network design
and experimental analysis and further developed my interesting generative approaches.
I’m really looking forward to learning more about self-supervised and generative methods at
SMILES-2025, as these areas are closely related to my current work on synthetic data. I’m
also diving deeper into natural language processing—especially large language models and the
ideas behind their architectures—with the hope of contributing something meaningful to this
fast-moving field.
One of the most exciting aspects of SMILES is international collaboration. Working alongside
talented peers from [location], [location], and beyond creates the opportunity for
intellectual exchange and personal development. During my internship at [company], I had the privilege of interacting
with colleagues from [location] and was inspired by their deep technical insights and cultural features. I’m looking forward to being part of a similarly inspiring and collaborative community
at SMILES-2025.
As someone who has not previously participated in a summer school, I view SMILES as both a
challenge and an opportunity. I am highly motivated to take part in the school’s
workshops and hackathons, to learn directly from experts in the field, and to contribute actively to team-based
projects. I hope to connect with other students who share similar passions for AI research, and
I am confident that the SMILES experience will lay a strong foundation for future academic
collaborations.
Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a Master’s degree with a focus on Big Data and
Artificial Intelligence, where I aim to further explore generative AI and its applications. The knowledge and
experience gained through SMILES-2025 will play an important role in shaping my academic
direction and professional skills. While my primary motivation is to deepen my academic
expertise, I also see this program as a first step in advancing my career in machine learning
research.
In closing, I would like to thank you for considering my application. I’m genuinely excited
about the chance to join such a vibrant AI community, and I’d be truly honored to be part of
this year’s program.
Sincerely,
[name]
