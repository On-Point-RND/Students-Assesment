Introduction
•Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and challenging
to predict.
•Our goal is to build a deep learning model capable of
forecasting short-term price movements using historical
data from [compaany].
Data Collection
•Source: [compaany] API (real-time and historical data).
•Features used: open, close, high, low, volume.
•Timeframe: 1-minute, 5-minute, or hourly intervals.
•Preprocessing: normalization, outlier removal, time window
segmentation.
Methodology
•Models:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)
•Framework: PyTorch
•Target: Price N steps ahead
•Training: MSE loss, Adam optimizer, early stopping.
Forecast & Evaluation
•Metrics used:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Directional Accuracy (% of correct trend predictions)
•Example performance:
LSTM achieves ~65% directional accuracy on test data
Predictable horizon: up to 30 minutes ahead
Results
•Neural models outperform naive baselines (e.g., moving
averages).
•Captures short-term trends effectively, though long-term
forecasting remaiins challenging.
•Visualization:
•Actual vs Predicted prices chart
•Model architecture diagram
Future Work
•Integrate external signals: news, social media sentiment.
•Experiment with Reinforcement Learning agents for trading.
•Add uncertainty quantification and ensemble models.
Conclusion
Our deep learning models show promising results in crypto
price forecasting.
The project can be extended into real-time prediction and
algorithmic trading applications.
