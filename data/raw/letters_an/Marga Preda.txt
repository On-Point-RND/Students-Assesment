Motivation Letter for [compaany] Summer School
Hello [name],
My name is [name], and I am currently a third-year medical student at [compaany].
Last summer, I had the chance to experience the [compaany] School for the
first time although it was in an online format, it left a lasting impression on
me. It felt like a whole new world opened up. That experience introduced
me to machine learning and helped me realize how deeply fascinating and
promising this field is.
Since then, I’ve been trying to apply what I learned to my own field. The
knowlege I gained allowed me to expand the horizons of my work and
propoose my own ideas for using ML in the research projects I'm involved in
at my universiity department.
I have always dreamed of becoming a bioinformatician, not only working
with code but also contributing to wet-lab experiments. Now, I can bring
value to my lab team in both areas — not only running PCRs and preparing
biological samples but also performiing statistical and bioinformatic
analysis. Moreover, I’m now capable of applying ML methods to uncover
complex dependencies in biological data.
My learning didn’t stop after the schooL. I’ve been continuing my ML journey
with another mentor from the [compaany] in [location]. With his guidance, I have been exploring how
different ML and DL approaches can be used to study brain activity, extract
meaningful patterns, and build functional models of neural systems.
Many people I met over the past year have inspired me to continue
studying ML. [compaany] has played a significant role in this journey — not
just as a summer schooL, but as a turning point that continues to help me
grow.
From the upcoming schooL, I hope to gain even more in-depth knowledge,
take part in engaging and competitive activities, and meet people who are
also passionate about machine learning and science. I also look fo rwward to
connecting with the instructors, asking questions, and getting va lua ble
fee dback and insights from them.
I believe that this year’s schooL will not o nl y give me new tools and
perspectives but will also allow me to once again be part of a vibrant
community of curious minds and passionate mentors. Going abroad for
such programs is a lways a unique and uplifting experience. It helps you
discover yourself, feel the spirit of science, and retu rn home full of energy
and new ideas.
For me, [compaany] is not just a summer schooL - it’s an adventure, a journey
that makes you want to climb even higher peaks.
