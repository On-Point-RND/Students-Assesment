Hello,
First, I'd like to share a bit about myself: I'm 19 years old and have been passionate about DS for over 4 years and IT technologies for more than 8 years. I've won competitions in NLP, and projects I've contributed to have received the Aij (AI Journey) award. I occasionally give talks and teach machine learning. I've worked on quite diverse projects ranging from CV and Classic ML to NLP. While I don't consider myself a mathematical genius, years of focused practice in machine learning have equipped me with sufficient knowledge to conduct serious research.
Regarding my motivation: I'm deeply attracted to the summer school topics as they focus on language modeling and other cutting-edge directions at the forefront of science. I see this school as a unique opportunity to discuss my own ideas and develop new concepts related to innovative Llm architectures.
Transformers have undoubtedly revolutionized machine learning, but in their standard form, I believe they're approaching their limits. Furthermore, modern language models can only imitate human preferences â€” they can simulate thinking, but cannot truly think. These limitations represent fascinating research challenges that I'd like to dedicate my efforts to.
Participating in the summer school at [location] will be not just an educational experience for me, but also a chance to meet leading researchers and contribute to the development of machine learning. I aspire not merely to follow current trends, but to actively participate in shaping the future of this exciting field.
