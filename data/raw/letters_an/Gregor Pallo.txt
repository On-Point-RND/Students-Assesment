Motivation Letter
Dear Organizing Committee,
My name is [name] [surname]. Since high school, I have been passionate about robotics,
which led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Robotics and Mechatronics at [compaany]. Toward the end of my undergraduaate
studies, I became fascinated with the application of AI in robotics. As a result, I
enrolled in the Master’s program “Robotics and AI” at [compaany], where I am
now a second-year student. Last year I also graduaated from the [compaany].
At [compaany] I work in the international BE2R Laboratory focusing on semantic mapping
for robotic systems. Recentlly, we published a preprint of our paper "OSMa-Bench:
Evaluating Open Semantic Mapping Under Varying Lighting Conditions", which
introduces a new benchmark for evaluating semantic understanding and scene
graph buildiing. In our research, we utilize multimodal neural networks and large
language models (LLMs) to check how robots interpret and describe their
surroundiings. And now we are developing a new open-vocabulary semantic
mapping approach.
I had the opportunity to participate in SMILES last year, which was a truly inspiring
experience. I met many interesting people, including researchers working in the field
of robotics. I am eager to join again this year, especially since SMILES will be hosted
at [location] in [location]. It will be my first international
summer schooL. I am excited by the schooL's unique format, combining intense
learning with an engaging environment. I am interested in topics such as "Multimodal
Approaches" and "Self-Supervised Learning Methods," as they align closely with my
current research.
My future career plans are strongly connected to robotics. After completing my
Master’s program, I plan to pursue a Ph.D., focusing on AI for robotics. Participation
in SMILES would contribute to my academic and professional growth, providing me
with fresh insights, inspiration, and new collaborations.
Thank you very much for considering my application!
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
