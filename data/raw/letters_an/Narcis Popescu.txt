Dear Selection Committee,
I am writing to express my sincere interest in joining your upcoming Machine
Learning & Deep Learning Summer School. As someone who is deeply passionate
about artificial intelligence, I view it not just as a techno logical trend but as a
transformative force capable of changing lives — and I aspire to be among those who
steer this transformation. Attending your school is a unique opportunity to strengthen
my technical foundation, connect with like-minded peers, and grow both as a
researcher and a person.
My primary motivation in pursuing machine learning is to use technology to
improve people’s lives and health. One of my long-term goals is to contribute to
increasing human lifespan and improving its quality through medical AI applications.
I believe that well-designed models can support early diagnosis, monitoring, and
personalized treatment — and I want to be part of that future. My Master’s thesis,
which focuses on classifying ECG signals using Transformers and KAN models,
directly aligns with this ambition. I was able to compress the model 30-fold while
maintaining performance, making it deployable on simple microcontrollers — a
crucial step for use in everyday healthcare devices.
In addition to my academic work, I’m deeply inspired by sharing knowledge. I
believe that knowledge is one of the most powerful forces that drive our world
forwards — and I am committed to contributing to this movement by helping others learn and grow. Whether it's organizing AI hackathons or creating resources for
beginners, I find joy and purpose in enabling others to discover the power of machine
learning.
Beyond the classroom, multi-agent systems are a personal area of fascination.
As a hobby, I develop agent-based games and simulations that explore emergent
behavior, coordination, and decision-making — a creative outlet that reinforces my
understanding of autonomous systems and intelligent agents.
What excites me most about your summer school is the opportunity to combine
cutting-edge theoretical insights with hands-on practical challenges, all while
engaging with a vibrant and driven community. I am especially eager to explore
advanced topics in computer vision and AI agents, and to collaborate with other
participants who share a passion for building meaningful and responsible AI.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to contribute to your program and learn from its distinguished faculty and participants. I hope to bring my unique perspective, technical experience, and deep motivation to use AI for
the greater good.
Sincerely, [name] [surname]
