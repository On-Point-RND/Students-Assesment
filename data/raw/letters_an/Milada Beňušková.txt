As I mentioned in my resume, at the moment I am mostly familiar with the basics, and I feel that this is not enough to effectively solve complex, multifaceted problems or to find new approaches, which I would really like to do. I have always been interested in ecology and climate change, and my introduction to the world of oceanology helped me find my place in professional life. I can say that the topic of my current work was love at first sight. Machine learning seems to me the most suitable tool for working with vortex clustering.

I hope that within the framework of my masterâ€™s thesis on the stratospheric polar vortex, I will be able to train a model with sufficiently good accuracy and generalization on the data currently available. This will help to forecast weather in advance and, possibly in the future, explain some other phenomena occurring in the stratosphere.

I have many plans, both for pursuing a PhD and for the rest of my life. It would be wonderful if your school becomes a part of this journey and helps me develop the necessary skills to achieve my goals. The topics proposed by the school seem to me like the next step. I am not yet familiar with them, but I hope I will have the opportunity to change that.

Undoubtedly, getting to know other participants will also be important. Sharing experiences, ideas, problems, and their solutions is just as essential in such events, as I already know from experience. Such communities allow you to give an opportunity for fully immersing in learning new material and find like-minded people, possibly future partners, colleagues, or even friends. Both of these aspects seem equally valuable to me.

Thank you for your attention)
