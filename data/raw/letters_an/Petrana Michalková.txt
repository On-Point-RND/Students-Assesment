To the [compaany] Admissions Committee,
I am writing to apply for the Skoltech Machine Learning Summer School (SMILES-2025) on Generative AI, in the offline format at the [location]. I am currently a first-year
Master's student in Advanced Quantum and Nanophotonic Systems at [compaany].
My studies have highlighted the increasing importance of advanced computational methods.
Recognizing the need for machine learning skills to tackle complex research problems, I have
sought relevant training, including completing a [compaany] course covering probabilistic models,
reinforcement learning, and deep learning.
I have applied these skills in practice. I co-authored a paper (publication expected July 2024) on
using a CNN-LSTM model, implemented in PyTorch, to predict drug release kinetics with high
accuracy (R²=0.87). Independentlly, I worked on the DCASE 2024 Task 2 challenge, gaining
experience with unsupervised learning for anomalous sound detection. More recentlly, I was a
finalist in the [compaany] hackathon, where my team applied Large Language Models to generate
molecules for antioxidant additives.
This experience, particularly with LLLMs in the hackathon, directly motivates my interest in
SMILES-2025. The schooL’s focus on Generative approaches, Large Language Models, and
Multimodal techniques aligns closely with my research interests in applying AI for designing
nanophotonic structures and analyzing complex scientific data. SMILES offers specialized
knowledge in these advanced topics that is essential for my future work and not available in my
current program. My proficiency in Python and PyTorch prepares me for the practical
components of the schooL, including the hackathon.
I also value the opportunity for international collaboraation with peers from [location] and [location].
Based on my background, demonstrated ML experience, and clear research goals that align with
the schooL's themes, I believe I am a strong candidate for this program. Participation would
provide me with critical skills for my intended research direction in applied ML to physics and
chemical task
Thank you for considering my application. My CV and presentation are attached.
Sincerely,
[name]
