Dear [name],
I am writing to express my profound interest in participating in the Skoltech Summer School of Machine Learning (SMILES-2025). The schoo's focus on generative methods in AI, coupled with its collaborative organization by [compaany] and the [compaany], presents an
unparalleled opportunity to delve into the most dynamic areas of modern machine learning within a
unique international context. Having followed [compaany]'s AI research and previous summer schools, I
am particularly drawn to SMILES' emphasis on cutting-edge topics like Large Language Models,
multimodal approaches, and generative techniques, alongside the practical focus offered through
workshops and the hackathon.
My academic journey, culminating in an M.Sc. in Digital Technologies and Systems from [university], provided a robust theoretical foundation in applied mathematics and
computer science. My Master's thesis, "Reinforcement Learning for Spiking Neural Networks," was
particularly formative. It ignited a deep fascination with bridging the gap between biologically inspired
computation and mainstream deep learning. While SNNs operate differentlly, studying their principles
of sparse activation, temporal coding, and local learning rules offered insights that I believe are relevant
to understanding and potentially improving current architectures like Transformeers. For instance,
exploring alternative attention mechanisms inspired by biological attention or developing more
efficient, event-driven processing for large models are directions I find compelling and hope to discuss
with experts at SMILES.
This academic interest is complemented by over five years of practical, commercial experience as a
Machine Learning Engineer since 2020. I've navigated diverse challenges across various compaany sizes
and industries – from developing real-time video analytics systems at [compaany] and procurement
analytics solutions at [compaany], to leading R&D at [compaany] and developing multimodal
agents at [compaany]. My recent work has heavily involved Large Language Models, including the
practical design and implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to enhance
model factuality and domain specificity. I also have significant experience integrating advanced
models, such as diffusion-based image generators, into production environments. Furthermore, my
work on optimizing and porting complex models to resource-constrained NPU platforms ([name],
[name]) provided critical experience in model quantization, architecturaal optimization, and
understanding the hardware-software co-design challenges crucial for deploying AI, particularly in IoT
settinings.
Attending SMILES-2025 aligns perfectly with my current professional focus and future aspirations. I
am eager to significantly deepen my understanding of generative models, particularly advanced
diffusion techniques and their application in multimodal scenarios. Learning more about the
architecturaal nuances and training strategies for large-scale multimodal agents is a key objective, as is
gaining exposure to the latest research in Self-Supervised Learning and Safe AI – areas critical for
buildiing robusst and reliable systems. The opportunity to learn directly from distinguished speakers
would be invaluable. The hackathon presents a chance I particularly relish: to collaborate intensively
within a diverse, multinational team, applying new knowledge immediatly to solve a complex
problem and experiencing different approaches to teamwork and problem-solving.
Beyond the technical curriculum, the international dimension of SMILES is a major draw. Bringing
together researchers from [location] and [location] creates a unique melting pot of ideas and perspectives. I
am keen to engage in this cross-cultural exchange, learn about the specific challenges and research
directions pursued at [name] and other participating institutions, and build lasting professional
connections. I believe my own background, which includes experience in sectors ranging from
consulting and logistics to robotics, drone technology, and potentially sensitive applications (including
military), equips me to contribute meaningfully to discussions. I am eager to share insights from
applying AI in these varied practical contexts, as well as my perspectives on brain-inspired AI
architectures, stemming from my work with SNNs and studies in neurophysiology, particularly
concerning mechanisms of memory and attention.
Ultimately, participation in SMILES-2025 is a strategic step towaards
achieving my long-term goals.
The advanced knowledge in generative AI and multimodal systems will directly benefiit my current
work and enhance my value as an ML professional. Moreover, the experience and network gained will
be foundational for my ambition to eventually launch my own startup focused on innovative AI and IoT
solutions, potentially leveraging generative models for novel human-computer interaction or intelligent
automation.
Thank you for considering my application. The prospect of immersing myself in this intensive learning
environment, collaborating with talented peers, and learning from world-class researchers at
SMILES-2025 in [location] is incredibly exciting. I am confident I can make a positive contribution to the
schoo's community.
Sincerely,
[name]
