Application for SMILES Competition 2025
[location]
Dear SMILES Competition Committee,
I am eager to participate in the SMILES Competition 2025 at [compaany], a platform that aligns with my passion
for advancing machine learning. With over three years of experience as a Machine Learning Engineer, I am
excited to contribute my expertise to [compaany]’s innovative research community.
My enthusiasm for ML sparked at [university], where I deeply studied deep learning and computer vision. To
further my expertise, I enrolled in the joint [compaany] and [university] Master’s in ML
Engineering, focusing on advanced algorithms and scalable systems. Professionally, I optimized real-time
perception models at [compaany], reducing latency by 20%, and built NLP systems at [compaany],
achieving 95% accuracy for millions of data points daily.
SMILES offers a unique opportunity to tackle complex ML challenges, leveraging my skills in computer vision
and NLP. I am inspired by [compaany]'s commitment to AI research and aim to deliver impaactful solutions while
learning from fellow participants.
Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my skills and dedication make me a strong
candidate for SMILES 2025.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
