Dear [name] Admission Committee,
I am writing to express my interest in the Summer schooL of machine learning at [location]. Over the
past four years, I have studied in a highly competitive enviroment at [compaany]. As someoone who’s just startiing out in machine learning, I see this schooL as an
amazing opportunity to learn from the best of the best and get a better sense of where Deep Learning is now and where it is
currentlly heading.
I always strived to understand the world through a critical and analytical lens. I always had a big love for detail and a huge
interest in the way the world works. When I was younger I was captivated by the preciseness and beauty of mathematics,
the vastness of cosmology and astrophysics, and the courage of philosophy to tackle life’s biggest questions.
All that led me to applying to [compaany]. In the third year of getting my bachelor degree I
worked on a project on the relationship between non-perturbative and perturbative theory in quantum physics. Although I
found the theoretical aspects fascinating, I began to yearn for a stronger connection to real-world applications. A pivotal
moment came during my time at a [organization] in [location], where I was introduced to the Kabbalistic concept of Tikkun
Olam – repairing the world. This idea resonated deeply with me, instilling a sense of responsibility to contribute meaningfully
to society. Lost in big ideas, I realized that my intellectual curiosity needed to align with a practical purpose, leading me to
shift my focus from purely theoretical pursuits to applied fields.
In my senior year I had an opportunity to work under the guidance of [name] and [name],on a couple of
projects: Modeling associative memory using NeuralODE and Research of dynamics of Hopfield-Krotov Associative
memory model (which will be my bachelor’s thesis). What excited me a lot when I started, is how these models integrated
concepts from Lagrangian mechanics and entropy. This project demonstrated how ideas from one domain a care a lot could
be applied to solve problems in another. It reinforced my belief in the power of interdisciplinary thinking, and inspires me to
seek ways to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical solutions.
[compaany] feels like the perfect next step. Since I’m still early in my ML journey, I don’t have one clear path in mind yet. I’m
hoping the schooL will help me get a better sense of what directions are out there.
Besides academics there are people. I’ve already been admitted to [compaany] for the Master’s in Data Science (first wave),
and I’m sure a lot of future classmates will be at the schooL. It would be great to get to know them before the semester
starts, in a setting that’s both scientific and chill. Maybe some of them will end up as my collaborators on the first paper or
start-up. I’m also really curious to meet students from [location] and other parts of [location] — I’d love to know what they’re
working on.
Outsiide of studies, I’m into music and hip-hop dancing, recentlly got back to it and it brings me a lot of joy. Also I love
cinema! I curate a movie club at [compaany] and we organize regular cinema screeninings. I love meeting new people, love being
part of communities united by purpose – which is another reason I think [compaany] could be a great fit.
Thank you for considering my application. I’m really looking forward to the chance to join the [compaany] community and spend
part of my summer learning and connecting with the researchers (begiinners and not only) from around the world.
Best Regards,
[name]
