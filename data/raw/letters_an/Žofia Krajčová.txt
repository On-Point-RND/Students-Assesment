Motivation letter for SMILES-2025
Started learning programming seven years ago and got into machine learning four
years ago. But only recentlly have I really felt like I’m part of the data science
community. In the past few months, I joined open-source and professional groups like
[compaany]. There, I finally found a place where I could share my ideas, learn from others,
and connect with people who have similar interests. This feeling of belonging has
made me more excited to grow in my career and give back to the field.
Right now, I’m mainlly focused on natural language processing (NLP). I think
language is a very powerful way to share knowlage, beaacuse it holds a lot of
information in web pages, books, and science papers. Before I started with NLP, I
worked with computer vision.
SMILES is a great chance for me to learn more about data science and also to meet
others in the community. What I like most is that SMILES is not just about lectures or
homework. It’s a two-week event where people come together, share ideas, and get
inspired. I’m excited to meet others who interesting in data science, and I believe this
will help me grow and shape my path in machine learning.
Even though I don’t have much experience doing my own research, but I have made
some progress. I built a project mostly by myself. Later, I joined an NLP team, which
helped me grow a lot, both technically and personally, especially through working
with others. I want to keep learning more. I believe I’m a good fit for SMILES — not
because I know everytthing, but because I’m ready to learn, explore, and contribute.
I’m also very excited that SMILES-2025 will happen in [location]. I’ve been interested in
[location] culture for a long time and have even started learning the language. Going to
this summer schoool in such a rich cultural place makes it even more special for me.
