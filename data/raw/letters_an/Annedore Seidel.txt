How I Got Into Programming and Why I Chose Analytics
Like most of my peers, my journey into programming began with preparing for the Unified State
Exam (EGE) in computer science. I started learning Python because it was the simplest language
for the exam, and along the way, I grew fond of it. Python captivated me with its simplicity, yet
incredible potential, which I wanted to harness :)
After passing the exam, I became curious about where Python is used (I didn’t want to part with
it) and discovered the field of analytics, where about 90% of the work is done in Python.
I didn’t participate in programming competitions, but to improve my skills, I enrolled in School
21 — a development project by [compaany]. Somewhere online, I read that they had an "ML"
(machine leaning) track, and I decided that was exactly what I needed.
For me, digging into data and finding patterns is fascinating (I’ve always been good at it), and
it’s amazing that you can train models to help you make predictions. It feels almost "magical" to
be able to predict, for example, the price of a car based on just a few thousand numbers.
At universiity, I encountered assignments in C++, but it wasn’t quite what I wanted to focus on.
However, I do know the C language well, as I studied it extensively at School 21.
That’s how I started learning Python for data analytics through books, video tutorials, and at
School 21.
Why I Decided to Apply to This School
I understand that my knowledge in this field is still limited, but I am eager to gain experience and
improve myself, steadily moving towards my goal — landing my first full-time job.
I chose this schoo lbecause I see great potential in it and believe that it can teach me a lot.
