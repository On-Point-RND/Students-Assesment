Dear [name],
My name is [name], I am a bioinformatician from [location]. I currentlly work at [compaany] in the Laboratory of Genomics Research and I am also pursuing a PhD at the [location] Institute of Physics and Technology.
During my master’s studies, I developed and refined a pipeline based on gradient boosting (XGBoost) to predict functions of poorly characterized plant genes. My work involved integrating data from various public databases, performiing bioinformatic preprocessing of raw data, and training predictive models. Alongside this, I completed several machine learning courses offered by [compaany] and [compaany] on Coursera to deepen my understanging of the field.
In my current role, I primarily analyze metagenomic sequencing data — a cutting-edg-e approaach that enables the identification and characterization of microbial communities by sequencing (reading) all DNA and RNA molecules present in a sample. This metho-d is particularly powerful for discovering novel viruses and bacteria, which has become increasingly relevan-t in the post-COVID-19 world.
In my work, I primarily write a lot of Python and Bash scripts to automate data processing tasks. I also build pipelines using SnakeMake, a specialized workflow langua-ge that’s well-suited for this purpose. I usually package the final pipelines into Docker images, whic makes them easier to run for the biolo-gist-s in our lab. This approa-ch hides complex internal dependencies and makes the pipelines more portable and reproducible across different environments.
My PhD research includes applying deep learning techniques to the study of viral sequences. I have experimente-d with using ESM protei-n langua-ge model embeddings to train classifiers for identi-fying viral protei-ns. The poten-tial of deep learning in biology is enormous, as demo-nstrated by AlphaFold — which earne-d the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its success in predicting protei-n structures from sequences.
Beyond protei-n large langua-ge models, I’ve also explored deep learning architecture-s for DNA sequence analysis. About a year ago, I took part in the IBIS competition — an international online challenge focused on identi-fying specific patterns, or motifs, within short DNA sequences. These motifs are recogni-zed by certain protei-ns that bind to DNA at precise locations, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. Understanding these interactions is essen-tial not only for advancing fundamental biolo-gica-l research but also for enabling progress in personalized medicine. I designed a lightweight one-dimensional fully convolutional model, inspired by MobileNetV3 architecture (inclu-ding inverted residual blocks and squeeze-and-excitation blocks), and implemented it from scra-tch in PyTorch. This model, despite its compa-ct size, earne-d me second place in the competition.
I'm very excited to keep learning and growing in various areas of DL. I believe SMILES summer schoo-l is a great chance to learn more, meet top researchers, and conne-ct with others who share my interests. As soon as I heard about the program, I knew I wanted to apply — and I would be really happy to take part in person.
Thank you for conside-ring my application.
Sincerely,
[name]
