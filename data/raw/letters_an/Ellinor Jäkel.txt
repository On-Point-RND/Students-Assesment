Dear[name]SelectionCommittee,
My name is [name], and I would like to present myself as a candidate for the SMILES 2025 summer school. In this letter, I will outline my background, scientific and industrial interests, expectations of the summer school, and how they align with my experience and career goals. With a tremendous wealth of experience in designing and implementing software solutions, enormous interest in NLP research and industrial applications, and an extremely strong desire to work and exchange ideas both with the [location] research community and with the global one, I perceive this summer school as an excellent opportunity to develop professionally both as a research scientist and a real-world developer.
As I was studying for my bachelor’s degree at the Mathematics and Mechanics Faculty of [university], I received solid mathematical education and some substantial experience in software development. I was a middle-graded developer at [company] and took part in two industrial projects at [institution]—cooperating with the Mobile Robotics Lab and AgroCenter. While being productive in my early positions, I deliberately took the decision of altering my profession towards machine learning on the basis of my prior experience as a foundation to achieve the same.
I am since 2024 pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science at [institution] and contributing towards developing major product at [startup]. During this time, I’ve established a strong foundation in ML, DL, NLP, LLMs, and memory-efficient model training, while being involved in pretty interesting sets of projectslike Asynchronous Diffusion Models Evaluation and Overview of Matrix Completion Algorithms. At [startup] as well, I became involved with the industrial side of ML solution development. I have been working along with the team to develop and deploy an in-production grade RAG system for cybersecurity using technologies such as [technology 1], [technology 2], [technology 3], [technology 4], [technology 5], [technology 6], and [technology 7]. I have been researching at the [institution] Natural Language Processing lab alongside Professor [surname] since December 2024 in the field of LLM knowledge editing. I have thoroughly explored this field and experimented with several approaches; now, I am researching supervised fine-tuning as a second approach to knowledge editing, with publication potential. This part of my experience is described in great detail in the video and presentation included with the application form. Also, my area of research includes efficient training of LLMs on large distributed clusters—more specifically, I am researching block implementations of high-level optimization methods like Muon and Lamb in collaboration with Professor [surname].
Although I have achieved gigantic progress over the past year, I think that it is imperative for me to approach the challenges that I encounter from different dimensions, share findings with others, and receive constructive feedback. I would like to be able to work with both Russian experts, such as [name] and [name], and global experts such as [name], who work in the same field but not at [institution]. Having the opportunity to attend this conference would allow me access to their work. Additionally, dozens of bright students who may become my research partners or future colleagues during and after the summer school will be selected to attend.
As for individual projects that I might work on over the summer school, [name] has projects associated with distributed training of LLMs (e.g. Distributed Fine-tuning of Language Models on Private Data), which would be interesting to investigate, especially in the context of experiments on optimization and editing knowledge in large models. I am also interested in the paper Revisiting Mahalanobis Distance for Transformer-Based Out-of-Domain Detection, which runs experiments to track out-of-domain queries. Its results can be applied to editing knowledge potentially since most of the methods rely on determining whether changes to knowledge are needed for answering some questions or not. This work can be my summer school project.
In short, with a strong mathematical and software development foundation, I have progressed significantly in ML as a whole and NLP specifically over the past year, both academically and industrially. I am interested in research and industrial application of LLM training methods, knowledge editing, and scalable distributed optimization. The ability to communicate with new peers and feel the special environment of the summer school is an opportunity to take this research to the next level, which would play an important role in my career. Thank you for your time to consider my application. I will be more than glad to respond to any questions about my past experience or current interests.
Sincerely,
[name]
