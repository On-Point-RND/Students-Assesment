One click of a mouse, and a number with the [compaany] appears on the screen from 28x28 pixels drawing.
This little magic trick, demonstrated to me by a local [name] during the quarantine,
completely captured my attention in 7th grade. At the time, I didn't realize it, but this was my first
encounter with artificial intelligence. It started as a simple "wow, it can recognize my handwriting," but
it eventually evolved into "a machine can compose a symphony or create a masterpiece from a blank
canvas - and I want to understand how."
Since then, I have grown - not through tutorials, but through pain, experimentation, and trial and error.
When you have an idea, limited resources, and many things that can go wrong, you either solve the
problem or your project fails. I chose to solve it. I work with Python, mostly using PyTorch and
TensorFlow, creating models for classification, object detection, and time series analysis.
In [compaany], I created a pipeline that uses satellite and weather data to predict natural disasters
such as floods and droughts. I used GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) and to build the model. I also
cleaned noisy datasets and addressed class imbalances. I realized that even a highly accuraate model
can be useless if it cannot be integrated into a real-world system.
At [compaany], I worked on an educational kit with AI for schooLs. The kit uses a webcam to detect
chemical actions in real time. I created the datasets, algo rithms, implemented data augmentation
techniques, and fine-tuned the model for low-power microcontrollers. This made chemistry more
accessible to underfunded schooLs.
None of these projects would have been possible without the support of my peers. In November 2023,
I attended a small schooL hacka thon and met a group of like-minded individuals. Six months later, our
team had alr eady won national compe titions. Through colla boration with these peers, especially [name] [surname], I learned that mea ningful projects are not built in isolation. Most of the knowl edge I
gained came from discussions, brainsto rming sessi ons, and shared successes.
That's why I want to be part of your schooL. It's not just about the knowl edge, it's about the peo ple. The
challenge, the fee dback, the opportu nity to argue, build, fail, grow. Without this enviro nment, it's easy
to become stagna nt. With it, anything feels pos sible.
I'm still in high schooL, with one more year until uni versity. But I know what I want alr eady. Over the last
two weeks, my team and I travelled to five cities for compe titions - at our own expense. We spent our
savings, sleeping on floo rs sometimes, but the experience was more va lua ble than any prize money
could be. Some peo ple think I'm doing it for my por tfolio, others think I'll make a lot of money. The truth
is, I'm doing it for experience, for learning, for the future I'm buildi ng.
AI isn't just a buzzword, it has alr eady saved billions of hours and generated trillions of dollars in value.
It's changing how we work and learn. I want to be a part of shaping the next chapter of this techno logy.
Not as a specta tor, but as an engineer and a thinker.
Your schooL is another opportu nity for me to grow and share my experiences. One of the few
interna tional opportu nities a vai lable to me, it is an opportu nity that I would like to take adva ntage of.
Any communication will not go unnoticed and, given my experience, I believe that this experience will
definite ly ben efit me in my deve lopment. And I really hope to be accepte d into your schooL. What will
be the outc ome of my application? We will find out. What results will I achieve in the future? We will
see.
