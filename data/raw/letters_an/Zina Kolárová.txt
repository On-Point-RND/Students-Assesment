Motivational Letter for SMILES-2025

April 23, 2025
Dear SMILES-2025 Admissions Committee,
I am excited to apply for the SMILES-2025 summer school at [location], as it aligns perfectly with my
professional trajectory and research interests in generative AI and large language models (LLMs). With
my background as a Senior LLM Engineer at [company] and prior experience at [company], I am eager
to contribute to and learn from this international collaboration, particularly in advancing cutting-edge
techniques like MoE architectures, multimodal systems, and safe AI deployment.
Motivation
My journey into generative AI began at the [company] School of Data Analysis ([location]), where I
immersed myself in both the theoretical foundations and practical challenges of modern machine learning—from
efficient CUDA implementations to cutting-edge work on transformers and RL. This rigorous training,
combined with my industry experience at [company] and [company], has shaped my conviction that the
next breakthroughs in AI will emerge from international collaborations like SMILES-2025, where
diverse perspectives collide.
Three aspects of the school particularly resonate with me:
• Bridging Academia and Industry: At [location], I learned to appreciate how academic rigor
(like my research on 3D-GANs for medical imaging) can solve real-world problems—a philosophy
SMILES embodies. My work on MoE architectures at [company] has shown me how multimodal
systems benefit from this synergy, especially when optimizing cross-modal attention mechanisms.
• Safety as a First-Class Problem: While developing quantization techniques for LLMs, I’ve
seen how efficiency gains can inadvertently compromise model robustness. SMILES’ focus on safe
AI aligns with my [location] training in statistical validation—I’m eager to collaborate on frameworks
that ensure scalability doesn’t come at the cost of reliability.
• Learning Across Borders: My [company] projects involved adapting models for [location] and
[location], teaching me how cultural context shapes AI systems. SMILES’ [location]- [location] partnership
offers a unique testbed for studying how multi-agent systems might evolve differently across
technological ecosystems.
What excites me most is SMILES’ hands-on approach: the chance to pressure-test ideas like self-
learning methods for MoE models during hackathons, or to refine my [name] Compression techniques
with input from peers tackling similar problems in multimodal spaces. Having thrived in [location]’s inten-
sive environment, I’m confident I can both contribute meaningfully and absorb the school’s interdisci-
plinary ethos.
Relevant Experience
What excites me most about SMILES-2025 is the opportunity to bridge cutting-edge research with
real-world applications through international collaboration. My current work on efficient LLM training
directly connects with several school themes:
• For LLMs and Multimodal Systems: Exploring how mixture-of-experts architectures can
enable more adaptable multimodal agents
• InSafeAI: Investigating quantization and compression techniques that maintain model robustness
while reducing computational costs
• For Self-learning Methods: Developing approaches that combine efficient pretraining with
continual learning capabilities
I’m particularly eager to collaborate with researchers working at the intersection of these areas-especially
those bringing perspectives from different cultural and academic backgrounds. The chance to brainstorm
with [location] colleagues about scalable generative systems, or to workshop safety frameworks with the
school’s mentors, is exactly the kind of cross-pollination that leads to breakthroughs ideas.
Expectations & Career Goals
At SMILES-2025, I aim to:
• Engage with [location] and [location] researchers on scalable generative systems, leveraging my
MoE/quantization work.
• Explore safe AI frameworks for industrial LLM deployment—a critical gap in my current
projects.
• Contribute to hackathons by tackling real-world inefficiencies (e.g., multimodal latency reduction).
Long-term, I plan to lead R&D teams bridging academia and industry, and SMILES-2025’s mentorship
network would accelerate this. The school’s focus on international collaboration resonates deeply, as
my [company]/[company] projects involved cross-team coordination at scale.
Conclusion
I would be honored to join SMILES-2025 to both share my expertise and absorb insights from the diverse
participant pool. Thank you for your consideration—I look forward to the possibility of contributing to
this vibrant community.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
Senior LLM Engineer, [company]
