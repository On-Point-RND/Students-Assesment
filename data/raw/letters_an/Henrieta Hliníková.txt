Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Skoltech Summer
School of Machine Learning.
Currently, I am a first-year Master's student in Data Science at Skoltech.
I graduated with honors from the Higher School of Economics with a
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering
(GPA 8.27). My academic and professional journey is centered around
ensuring the safe and responsible use of artificial intelligence.
My current research focuses on LLM safety. I lead a project aimed at
developing a system for monitoring and protecting large language
models from prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. I actively promote
awareness of LLM-related security issues - for instance, in March I gave
an overview seminar at [company] on attacks targeting LLM-controlled robots.
This effort reflects my ongoing commitment to fostering a deeper
understanding of AI safety within the research community.
In addition to my academic work, I am a Data Scientist at [company], where I integrate LLM-based systems into SOC services. One of
my main contributions is KIRA, an AI assistant for SOC analysts, which
was recognized as one of the key innovations of 2024.
I am honored to have received several awards for my work, including the
Eugene Kaspersky Personal Scholarship, the Gennady Komissarov
Foundation grant for young scientists, and a national scholarship for
innovative research.
[location] is undoubtedly one of the global leaders in AI, and I see
SMILES-2025 as a unique chance to engage in international
collaboration with the Harbin Institute of Technology. This would not only
deepen my understanding of Safe AI but also expand my professional
network and expose me to new global perspectives on trustworthy and
secure AI development through collaboration.
My technical background, combined with strong communication and
leadership skills, makes me confident in my ability to contribute
meaningfully to the program.
Thank you for considering my application. Please find my CV attached
for further details on my qualifications and experience.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
