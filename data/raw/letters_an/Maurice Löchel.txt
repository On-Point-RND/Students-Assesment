I was thrilled to learn about your summer school and am very eager to become a participant. The [compaany] program appeals to me because it offers a deep dive into cutting-edge scientific research, challenging problem-solving, and learning from leading experts.
I have always enjoyed tackling complex problems, especially in the field of AI. At university, I actively participate in research projects and competitions (I am a prize-winner of the hackathon on cross-domain recommendation systems by [compaany] & [compaany]) and independently study additional materials to expand my knowledge. The [compaany] Summer School is a great opportunity to test my skills and grow further.
I am particularly inspired by the interdisciplinary approach of your school. I am confident that the lectures and hands-on assignments will help me develop stronger analytical thinking and expose me to the latest scientific trends. Additionally, I would love to connect with like-minded peers from different countries, exchange ideas, and possibly find inspiration for future projects.
I am ready to dedicate my full effort to making the most of my time at [compaany] and hope that my experience and passion for science will allow me to contribute meaningfully to the school. I would be delighted to join your summer school!
Best regards,
