Motivation for Participation
I am writing to express my enthusiasm for participating in the SMILES 2025
Summer School on Machine Learning, organized by [compaany] in collaboration
with the [location] Institute of Technology. As a passionate AI researcher in the
field of Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning, I am particularly drawn to
the school’s focus on generative methods, multimodal approaches, and multi-
agent systems. These areas align perfectly with my academic and research
interests, and I am eager to engage with leading experts and fellow researchers
to deepen my understanding and contribute to innovative projects.
Experience with ML/DL Tools
My experience in Machine Learning and Deep Learning is extensive, encompassing both theoretical research and practical applications. I have developed expertise in Python, R, and C/C++, utilizing tools such as NumPy, Pandas,
Sklearn, SciPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. My research has focused on solving
complex problems in Optimal Transport and Stochastic Optimal Control (as
mentioned in CV), which has equipped me with a robust skill set in both traditional and cutting-edge ML/DL techniques.
One of my notable achievements include the development of the “OWMM”
(OptimalWorkers’MovementsMap) software architecture, which leverages Neural Optimal Transport and Computer Vision for industrial production optimization. This project not only showcased my ability to apply advanced ML algorithms but also resulted in securing a government grant for its realization. Additionally, my ongoing research at the [compaany] (EMCO) involves
developing RL algorithms for Truck Dispatch Scheduling, further demonstrating my hands-on experience in implementing ML solutions in real-world scenarios.

Expectations from the School
Participating in SMILES 2025 presents an unparalleled opportunity to immerse
myself in a collaborative and intellectually stimulating environment. I am particularly excited about the chance to engage with renowned experts in the
field, attend state-of-the-art lectures, and participate in practical seminars and
hackathons. These activities will not only broaden my technical knowledge but
also enhance my problem-solving skills and foster creativity in approaching com-
plex AI challenges.
Moreover, I am eager to network with fellow participants from diverse back-
grounds, which will provide valuable insights into different research methodologiesand applications of AI.The cultural excursions and professional networking
opportunities offered by SMILES 2025 will further enrich my experience, allow-
ing me to build lasting connections with peers and mentors in the global AI
community.
Career Plans
My career aspirations are centered around advancing the field of Gen-AI and
RL through impactful research and innovative applications. Participating in
SMILES 2025 will be a pivotal step in achieving these goals, as it will provide
me with the knowledge, skills, and professional network necessary to excel in
my future endeavors.
Following the summer school, I plan to continue my research in Optimal
Transport and Stochastic Optimal Control, with a focus on its’ connections
with [location] Bridge. I am also committed to contributing to the academic
community by publishing my findings and collaborating with other researchers
to push the boundaries of AI.Ultimately,Iaimto leverage my expertise to drive
technological advancements and make a positive impact on society through the
responsible and ethical application of AI.
My long-term goal is to become a world leading AI researcher. In the short
term, I aim to:
• Complete my dual Master’s degrees
• Pursue a PhD in ML or Applied Mathematics
• Publish as many papers as I can
– Publish papers not just for quantity, but to engage in science-
intensive mathematical AI research!
In conclusion, I am highly motivated to participate in SMILES 2025 and
am confident that this experience will significantly contribute to my personal
and professional growth. I am eager to bring my unique perspective and skills
to the summer school and look forward to the opportunity to learn from and
collaborate with the esteemed faculty and participants.
Sincerely,
