Motivational Letter for SMILES-2025 Summer School
Dear Organizers of SMILES-2025,
My name is [name] [surname], and I’m completing my Master's degree in Physics at [location] [university], specializing in Optics, Spectroscopy, and Nanosystems. I also work as an engineer at [company], focusing on proteiin crystallization. Over the past few years, I’ve developed a strong interest in Data Science and Machine Learning (ML). In 2024, I applied the knowledge I gained from courses at [compaany] and self-study to solve real problems in the lab.
I first worked with ML and Deep Learning (DL) while developing a thermostat to control the temperature during proteiin crystallization. I used neural networks such as ResNet and DenseNet to classify stages of crystal growth. I also worked with other models like ResNet101, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT) to classify images of proteiin crystals. This resulted in an accuracy of over 90% in predicting crystallization outcomes and showed how ML can be used to analyze biological data. I also helped automate scientific research by combining ML with laboratory equipment.
SMILES-2025 is a great opportunity for me to expand my knowledge of AI, especially in areas like generative models, large language models, and multi-agent systems. I am excited to attend hands-on seminars and collaborate with experts in the field.
I recentlly visited [location], and the experience made me more motivated to pursue international collaboration. I’m now considering a PhD in AI or ML, potentially at [university]. I believe the experience at SMILES-2025 will help me advance my career and connect with professionals in the AI community.
I’m eager to improve my skills, learn more, and contribute to the discussions and projects at SMILES-2025. I believe this experience will play an important role in my future in AI and ML research.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to attend SMILES-2025 and improve my skills in AI and machine learning.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
