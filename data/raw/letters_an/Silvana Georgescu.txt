Hello,
For the past two years, I have been participating in SMILES online. Both times, I successfully passed the exams and presented research projects developed within the school (last year, I even took part in two).
SMILES is an amazing experience - I've learned a lot, met fascinating people, and even found a collaboration in drug design.
Currently, I work as a lead machine learning engineer at [company], focusing on LLMs and multimodal networks as part of my side projects.
Of course, I would love to take part in the School again this year.
I regret that I won't be able to attend in person - but, well... work.
Thank you in advance!
