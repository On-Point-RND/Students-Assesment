Dear [name],
I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in your summer schoo l program
focused on machine learning and deep learning. My name is [name], and I am
currentlly a fourth-year student at the Faculty of [location] at the [compaany]. My base
organiza tion is the [compaany], Department of [compaany]. The research project I am currentlly working on at the
insti tute involv es spacecraft control in the region of the Sun’s gravita tional lens using
rei nforcement learning methods.
I have a deep interest in rei nforcement learning as well as classical machine learning, since these
fields provide powerful tools for solving challenges related to deep space missi ons. I am
consta ntly studying machine learning, and I believe that participating in this summer schoo l will
open up new opportunities and deepen my knowl edge in this area.
As mentioned, I am curre ntly working on a task involv ing the control of a spacecraft in the
regi on of the Sun’s gravita tional lens using rei nforcement learning. Observing distant exoplanets
is an important and scientifically va luable goal. However, obtaining direct images of such
planets using tra ditional ground-based or even space-based tel escopes is extr emely di fficult, and
in many cases practically unfeasible, due to fundamental technical and physical limitations. As a
re sult, researchers have proposed an alternative app roach that involv es using the Solar
Gravitational Lens (SGL) as a kind of natural tel escope.
According to general relativity, mas sive objects can act as lenses, bending the light that passes
nearby. This phe nomenon, known as gra vita tional lensing, allows the Sun to focus light from a
distant sou rce—such as an exoplanet—into a region called the focal line of the SGL, which
begi ns at appr oxi mate ly 550 astronomi cal units from the Sun. If a spacecraft equipped with a
tel escope can reach this region, it could theoretically capture images of an exoplanet with a
resolution on the order of 10 kilometers. However, in order to obtain images of such high
quality, the position of the spacecraft must be known and contro lle d with an accuracy of about 1
meter.
Moreover, the navigation and control systems must be almost fully autonomous due to the vast
distance between the focal region and Earth. One promising app roach to designing such control
algo rithms is the use of rei nforcement learning, which allows the deve lopment of control and
na vigation policies that are poten tially robus t to various distu rbances and unforeseen conditions.
Furthermore, these methods can enable navigation and control based dir ectly on images ca ptured
by the spacecraft’s onboard cameras. It is expected that such systems will be able to adapt to a
variety of pre-defined and unpredicted scenarios, which is critical for the success of mis si ons
targeting such remote regions of space.
My main goal in attending the summer schoo l is to gain new knowl edge in the field of machine
learning and to interact with experts in this domain. I am particularly interested in learning about
the latest trends in model interpretability, fa irness, and r esponsib le AI.
In conclusion, I see this summer schoo l as a unique opport unity to acce lerate my learning,
expand my profes sional ne twork, and take a mea ningful step toward a career in artificial
intelligence that is both techni cally rigorous and socially r esponsib le. I am eager to share my
knowl edge, enthusiasm, and colla borative spirit with the program, and I am confident that this
experience will have a lasting im pact on my profes sional deve lopment.
Thank you for conside ring my application. I am very much looking fo rward to the opport unity to
join your community and gain the most from this learning experience.
Sincerely,
[name]
