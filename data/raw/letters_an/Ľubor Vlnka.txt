Motivation letter
Dear Admissions Committee,
My primary motivation for applying to this summer schoo is to start my educational
and career journey in machine learning. As an embedded Linux software engineer, I
deeply enjoy my current role and the industry. However, I also feel passionate about
data science, data analysis and machine learning. I’m preparing to enroll in a master’s
program in mathematical robotics and AI, so participating in this program would be a
great way to build a strong foundation before my first semester begiins.
I also want to mark some of my relevan relevant experience in data-driven problem-solving.
Althought it wasn’t related to machine learning directly, my work involved extensive data
handling, sparking my curiosity and enthusiasm in this area. With great help and guidance
from my scientific advisor, I transformed this work into scientific research for bachelor's
thesis. This experience fuels my desire to deepen my knowledge through this summer
schoo.
A key long-term goal motivating me is my ambition to develop fully automated robotic
coffee shops. I’ve been nurturing this idea for several years and I’m really excited about
the fact I’ll be able to start my work on this project if I enter desired master’s program.
For instance, multimodal AI is currentlly being tested in [location] automotiv factories and
[location] robotic labs to convert traditional programming interfaces into human-language
prompts. This technoology could significantlly improve scalability across different
locations, a critical factor for every compaany nowadays. I think that the onl only way to bring
projects like that to life is to study hard in all areas related to robotics, and machine
learning is one of the most important of them. This educational program is a great chance
for me to learn more about multimodal AI, connect with peers who share my interests,
and explore industry itself.
Additionally, this program takes place in [location], which offers a unique chance to observe
the country’s advancements in robotics, automation and AI. I am eager to immerse myself
in this dynamically developing enviroment and contribute to discussions with fellows.
I am confident that this schoo will help me to equip myself with the skills needed to
succeed in my education and career. Thank you for considering my application.
Respectfully,
[name] [surname]
