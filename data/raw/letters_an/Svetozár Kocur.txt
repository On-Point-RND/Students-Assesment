To whom it may concern,
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in participating in the Summer School of Machine Learning 2025. I am truly amazed by how rapidly my life and work are being transformed by advances in machine learning. I feel incredibly fortunate to live in an era where science progresses at breakneck speed. To me, the scientific challenges before us resemble intricate puzzles waiting to be solved — puzzles whose solutions can reshape our world in real time.
During my school years, I discovered a passion for solving complex mathematical problems and competing in national and international olympiads — and I still seize every opportunity to participate, as it keeps my problem-solving skills sharp and my curiosity alive. Upon entering university, I was thrilled by all the opportunities available — from pure mathematics to applied programming, and set a goal to explore a variety of fields. After my first year of university, I completed an internship at [company], where I gained my first experience writing production code. Despite being offered the opportunity to stay, I decided that research — rather than goal-oriented jobs with well-defined solutions — would allow me to make the greatest impact. In my second year at university, I wrote a paper on pure combinatorics that was later accepted by a Q1 journal. This reinforced my confidence in the academic field, and by that time, my interests had shifted toward applied mathematics — probability, statistics, and machine learning.
In my third and fourth years, I immersed myself in the machine learning field and listened to every probability theory course offered by my faculty, as well as many specialized courses from our industry partners. I attended the [company] ML Camp, enrolled in the [company] School of Data Analysis, and joined the International Laboratory of Game Theory and Decision Making at [university], where I investigated Bayesian models for sequential decision processes. In the summer of 2024, I interned at [company] in [location], one of the most successful financial services firms in the world. There, I tackled a challenging ML task involving several terabytes of noisy, highly correlated time-series data with hundreds of features. I experimented with different ML approaches, designed feature-engineering pipelines, and collaborated closely with domain experts to improve forecast correlation. My current bachelor’s thesis on random graph models has allowed me to go through the full research cycle. When my advisor posed an open problem, I conducted a deep dive into the literature and discovered that it had already been solved. Together, we formulated a novel, compelling research question and made substantial progress on it. This process honed my skills in comprehensive literature review, hypothesis generation, and the selection of impactful research problems.
In the near term future, I have accepted an offer from [company] that I simply couldn’t decline: it provides an exciting, large-scale ML project and virtually unlimited computational resources to design and run experiments. At the same time, I will begin my master’s studies at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of [university], where I plan to write my thesis on a machine-learning topic. Looking further ahead, I intend to pursue a PhD in machine learning or a closely related area of statistics.
Building on my upcoming role at [company] and my master’s research, I am determined to remain at the cutting edge of machine learning as the field evolves faster than ever. SMILES-2025 presents an exceptional opportunity to navigate today’s rapidly shifting ML landscape and to identify the most promising directions for my work. I highly value collaboration and the exchange of ideas among like-minded researchers, and I am eager to engage in the school’s team-based hackathons, poster sessions, and networking events. With its emphasis on generative approaches, multi-agent systems, and safe AI — all areas that deeply resonate with my interests — this program will enable me to explore these critical topics alongside world-class speakers and mentors. Such a blend of pioneering insights, collaborative spirit, and focused training will be pivotal in shaping my research trajectory and in helping me connect with my future scientific advisor.
Thank you for considering my application.
Kind Regards,
