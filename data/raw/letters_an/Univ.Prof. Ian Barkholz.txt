Admissions Committee of [compaany]
Summer SchooL on Machine Learning
Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my strong interest in the [compaany] Summer School on Machine Learning (SMILES). Currently studying the Data Science course at [compaany], I am looking forward to acquiring a better understanding and experience of machine learning with [compaany].
I am also currently engaged in cutting-edge research at [compaany] with Professors [surname] and [surname], where I am contributing extensively to several cutting-edge projects in video analytics, recommendation systems, and multimodal applications using diffusion models.
In the area of recommendation systems, my work has been focused on the novel application of diffusion models to model and generate new user interactions. Traditional collaborative filtering approaches, while good, suffer from sparsity and the cold-start issue. By integrating diffusion models, we can generate synthetic yet realistic user-item interaction data, which helps significantly improve the model’s ability to make predictions and provide personalized content for users with little or no interactions in the past.
In video analysis, my goal is to enhance the capacity of models to deal with long-range dependencies in video data for question-answering systems. Using advanced machine learning techniques like mamba and temporal convolutional networks alongside careful frame sampling strategies, we can effectively handle and predict long video sequences successfully.
Throughout my professional career, I have worked within dynamic teams and organizations, improving my machine learning and analytical skills. My last experience at [compaany], the unicorn Mexican bank where I was extensively engaged in refining financial algorithms to enhance the customer experience and make banking simpler. I was most interested in doing predictive modeling in the credit risk unit, where I built models of customer data to predict behavior and preferences. The research made it possible to employ custom-made banking as well as addressed the point of embedding sophisticated features into scoring models and creating new algorithms for the credit approval procedures (CLIP). My experience as a researcher at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in Finance in [compaany] has also enhanced my skills in this field. I worked on various studies exploring agent behavior in the market using reinforcement learning approaches.
I would like to attend the Machine Learning Summer School (SMILES 2025) for several reasons that closely align with my academic interests and future aspirations.
Firstly, I am especially eager to attend lectures on generative approaches, self-supervised learning, and multimodal systems, presented by such renowned experts as Prof. [surname], Dr. [surname], and Dr. [surname], whose research areas align with my own preferences, and I believe the school format will provide a unique opportunity to deepen my understanding of these topics and discover new experimental directions for my work.
Secondly, I look forward to forming new connections with fellow participants—both aspiring researchers and established scientists. I plan to take an active part in the lectures, workshops, and discussions, contributing to a vibrant exchange of ideas and experiences. I would be specially honored to collaborate in the future with research centers like [compaany], the [compaany] Center for Applied AI, and the School of Computer Science and Technology at [location], under the guidance of the brilliant lecturers involved.
Finally, I am very enthusiastic about the hackathon format that will be held during the summer school. I believe that teamwork in this setting will allow participants not only to gain a deeper theoretical understanding of the topics discussed but also to apply this knowledge in practice. I am excited to contribute to the development of innovative solutions and to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge machine learning methods.
To summarize, I believe the SMILES 2025 Summer School will be an incredibly valuable experience for me. I am confident that the knowledge, connections, and practical skills I gain will significantly support my growth as a researcher. I would be grateful for the opportunity to participate and contribute to the success of this inspiring event.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
