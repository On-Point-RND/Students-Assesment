Dear [name],
My name is [name], and I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in person at the
SMILES-2025 Summer SchooL of Machine Learning, jointlly organized by [compaany] and the [compaany]. I am a second-year Master's student in Financial Mathematics and Technologies at [location], and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Systems Analysis and Applied Computer Technologies
from [location]. I have a deep passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence,
and I am motivated by the opportunity that SMILES-2025 offers to advance my knowledge in cutting-edge AI
topics while collaborating with a diverse group of peers and experts.
One of my primary motivations for attending SMILES-2025 is to deepen my skills in machine learning and to
expand my professional and academic network. Throughout my studies, I have actively sought to build
expertise in AI, from theoretical foundations to hands-on projects. However, I recognize that the field is
constantly evolving, especially with advanced areas like large language models, multimodal learning,
multi-agent systems, generative methods, and AI safety. The lectures and workshops at SMILES-2025 would
be an invaluable chance for me to learn directly from leading researchers and to stay at the forefront of these
developments. Additionally, by interacting with fellow participants from around the world in person, I hope to
form meaningful connections that can foster future collaborations and enrich my perspective as I continue my
career in AI.
I am also driven by a strong desire to apply machine learning for the betterment of society. In my view,
technology holds real value only when it positively impacts people's lives. My background in financial
mathematics has shown me how data-driven algorithms can improve decision-making in finance - for
example, by optimizing trading strategies or managing risk. Building on this, I want to broaden my scope and
learn how the latest AI techniques can be harnessed to address sociectal challenges in various domains such as
healtcare, education, or environmental sustainability. I believe in developing AI responsibly, ensuring that as
we push the bounindaries of what AI can do, we also prevent harm and maximize benefiits. This perspective
aligns with SMILES-2025's emphasis on AI safety in its curriculum.
My academic and project experience has prepared me well to contribute to and make the most of
SMILES-2025. During my bachelor's degree at [location] and now my master's at [location], I built a
strong foundation in applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science. I am proficient in several
programming languages and tools, most notably Python (along with libraries such as PyTorch, scikit-learn,
NumPy, and others for data science and deep learning) as well as C++. I have applied these skills in various
projects; for instance, I developed a custom reinforcement learning environment called ExecEnv as part of a
research-intensive project to model the optimal execution of stock market orders and their price impaact. In that
project, I implemented multiple market impaact models to enable an AI agent to learn optimal trading
strategies. This hands-on experience strengthened my coding and problem-solving abilities, and it also sparked
my interest in sequential decision-making and agent-based systems - topics I am eager to explore further
during the summer schooL.
In addition to my technical skills, I bring strong communication and leadership experience. I have taken on
leadership roles during my studies - for example, serving as the deputy head of the press center in a student
organization at my universiity. In that role, I organized educational events, created content to engage the
student community, and managed a team. I also enjoy sharing knowledge: I have mentored younger students
in their first programming projects. I am fluent in English and Russian, and I believe these soft skills will
enable me to actively contribute to discussions, group projects, and hackathons throughout the program.
Attending SMILES-2025 is not just an end in itself for me, but a stepping stone toward my future goals. One
of my key aspirations after the program is to pass on the knowledge and enthusiasm for machine learning to
the next generation. I plan to engage in teaching machine learning to childre children and teenagers in my community.
I also intend to leverage the knowledge and connections from the summer schooL in my career. I hope to
continue developing AI solutions that have a positive social impaact, while mentoring others along the way.
In conclusion, I am confident that my passion for machine learning, my solid technical background, and my
commitment to using AI for positive change make me a strong candidate for the SMILES-2025 Summer
SchooL. Thank you very much for considering my application. I would be honored to be part of
SMILES-2025, and I am excited about the opportunity to grow both personally and professionally through this
experience.
Sincerely,
[name]
