[name], a final-year Statistics undergraduate at [location]. When I first thought about my purpose for pursuing Machine Learning and Deep Learning, or even registering for this program, I didn't have a clear reason. My purpose lies somewhere in my journey, shaped by many events. Allow me to share this journey, through which my story gradually unveils my purpose.
Raised in a joint family in [location], my mother instilled in me an early love for mathematics, nurtured further by my teachers. Throughout my school years, I eagerly participated in math olympiads and loved exploring the depth and intuition mathematics offered. My first introduction to AI was when I saw the OSIMO humanoid at [institution]'s techfest, and around the same time, I had watched videos of [company]'s robots and was very fascinated by them.
Like most Indian students passionate about mathematics and engineering, I spent junior college preparing for the Joint Entrance Examinations, deeply enjoying advanced mathematics and problem-solving. Around this time, I got to know about the prestigious [institution]. Initially, I couldn't clear its entrance exam. Given my interest in robotics too, I took up mechanical engineering at [institution]. In my first year there, I enjoyed the courses in mathematics and mathematical modelling of mechanical systems the most. Motivated by my persistent love for math, I attempted [institution]'s entrance again, securing an All India Rank of 49 and finally earning a seat in [institution]'s flagship B.Stat program. This marked the first pivot in my journey. Here, I immediately fell in love with vector algebra and probability theory, not viewing them merely as statistical tools but as fundamental pillars enhancing my intuitive understanding of statistics.
Around this time, due to Chat-GPT, LLMs had become a huge buzz. [institution] hosts a winter school of deep learning every year, which is a 3-month intensive course on ML/DL. It is probably one of the best courses in India, with Nobel Laureates like Geoffrey Hinton having given lectures.
Being curious about what machine learning is, I took up this course at the end of my 3rd Semester. This was the second pivot in my journey. This course was deep-rooted in mathematical rigor, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The inspiration taken from the neurons in our brain to build a neural network, the way words were vectorised such that sentences with similar contextual meaning are closer in the embedding space, the way a multi-head attention block was built, learning all this was a surreal experience. Even in my [institution]'s coursework, this was around the time when I was introduced to logistic regression, the EM algorithm, and likelihood ratio tests. Everything felt like it was meant to be, and that this was exactly what I wanted to do.
The deep learning course had a great impact on me. In the summer break after my second year, I sat down with the Deep Learning course again, started understanding things in finer detail, and explored more resources, which I wasn't able to do before due to our hectic academics. I deep-dived into neural networks by reading Michael Nielsen’s open-source book on Deep Learning, I watched videos by 3Blue1Brown and statquest, read the “Attention is All You Need” paper, explored various other resources, and participated in Kaggle competitions. My fascination towards ML and DL had now turned into a passion. I dreamt of working as an ML specialist at a big tech firm, applying and expanding my knowledge on cutting-edge advancements.
At the start of my sixth (current) semester, Dr. Richik Sengupta, an associate professor at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute ([location]), approached my professor seeking an [institution] student to assist with ML research. My professor connected me with him. This was the 3rd pivot in my journey. I was now working with Dr. Richik Sengupta from [location] in his research on Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms and their time complexities. We both connected very well, sharing similar interests in mathematics and music too.
Working with Richik Sir has been an amazing and rewarding journey. Regardless of my hectic coursework, my immense interest in the problem we are working on led me to sometimes stop everything else that I was doing and spend sleepless nights trying to understand the research papers on Stochastic Gradient Descent and non-convex optimization. Throughout this journey with Richik sir, I’ve shown resilience, and we’re close to achieving notable results. It feels amazing being part of research, actively reading papers, wrecking your brains trying to understand all the aspects of it, proceeding with researching on your ideas, getting stuck, reading more, understanding more, having a breakthrough, only to get stuck again. It has been a joyride till now, and we are making consistent progress. I have become way more academically mature now and have immensely enjoyed working on very mathematical and theoretical research problems in the ML domain. Now, I don’t limit my dream to just working as an ML specialist. I dream to present and publish papers in top journals and A* conferences, I dream to conduct cutting-edge research and delve deeply into the mathematical and theoretical aspects of ML/DL.
Richik Sir informed me of the SMILES program and encouraged me to apply. I immediately liked the program, recognizing it as a chance to strengthen areas where I lack extensive exposure. Although I have studied generative AI concepts such as variational autoencoders, GANs, and diffusion models in depth, my exploration beyond foundational theory has been limited. SMILES provides me the opportunity to further my knowledge in Generative AI, representing the perfect next step in my journey. Given my strong background in Mathematics, Statistics, and Machine Learning, I am confident in my ability to grasp new concepts quickly and would make the best out of my time at the [location]. I believe that attending the SMILES 2025 program would be the fourth pivot in my journey. I really look forward to the program, interacting with peers and professors, and immersing myself in collaborative projects that push the frontiers of AI research. Thank You.
