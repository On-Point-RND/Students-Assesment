Dear [name],
I am writing to express my interest in attending your upcoming Summer School on Artificial Intelligence. As a student deeply engaged in the field of machine learning—particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP)—I view this program as a vital opportunity to expand my expertise and apply advanced techniques to real-world challenges.
My Background and Motivation
Over the past year, I have been actively involved in a team project focused on the reconstruction of business processes for a large [compaany]. The goal was to identify repeatable workflows across departments that could be standardized and automated. Within the team, I was primarily responsible for exploratory data analysis and machine learning-based process mining. This practical experience reinforced my passion for research and innovation in the NLP domain.
Selected Projects
1. Process Classification via Document Forms
We hypothesized that the types of document forms could reveal underlying process types. I implemented a classification pipeline where document sequences were encoded using LabelEncoder, initial classes were derived through set intersection, and a decision tree was trained to refine groupings. Jaccard similarity was then applied to finalize clusters, resulting in 97% of sequences grouped with an average similarity above 80%.
2. Modeling Action Transitions Using NLP
To segment user activity chains, we repurposed the RuBERT model for the Next Sentence Prediction task. I rewrote the model head to predict transition probabilities between actions. A dataset was prepared for time-series cross-validation, and predictions were used to slice sequences based on low-probability transitions. The result: over 70% alignment with expert-made segmentations.
3. Semantic Clustering of User Actions
Using Doc2Vec embeddings, UMAP dimensionality reduction, and MeanShift clustering, we explored categorizing user processes. While the hypothesis didn’t hold (due to low intra-cluster similarity), it was a valuable lesson in the limitations of unsupervised methods in this context.
4. OCR-Based Action Recognition
I contributed to a pipeline using Tesseract OCR with OTSU binarization to identify user actions from screen captures. I also developed a FastAPI backend for this tool, using ClickHouse for efficient data storage and retrieval.
5. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
I worked on a preprocessing module for employee activity data using pandas, regular expressions for anonymization, and customizable user settings to apply different processing rules.
6. Analytical Insights for Sequence Segmentation
I analyzed key action patterns to determine segmentation points in user workflows. This led to a major hypothesis focusing on the primary application window and time-based cutting, which was later adopted in the final system design.
Personal Initiative
I also led a team at the “Virbus Units 2025” hackathon, where we developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying data about [location]. We scraped the [compaany] website using Selenium and used the Llama3:8b model. I implemented both Query Translation (RAG-Fusion) and Indexing (RAptor), and built a WebSocket-based chat interface for real-time interaction with the system.
Why This Summer School?
My main track in machine learning is NLP, and I find the themes of your school especially relevant to my professional goals. I am particularly interested in how LLMs can be applied in tasks such as retrieval-based generation, summarization, named entity recognition, and text evaluation. These topics are not only fascinating academically but also critical to the socially meaningful applications I aim to build.
Attending your program would allow me to sharpen my skills, learn from experts, and connect with peers who share my passion for AI. I am eager to contribute to the learning community and apply new knowledge in future research and development projects.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of joining your Summer School and continuing my journey in AI.
Sincerely,
[name]
