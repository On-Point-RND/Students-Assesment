I am eager to attend the SMILES Summer School of Machine Learning, as its focus on
generative AI aligns perfectly with my research interests and PhD thesis objectives. I believe that this
program provides a unique opportunity to hone ones technical skills under the guidance of top-tier
experts spanning both academia and industry.
During my intermediate-year Medical Biochemistry courses at [university], I realized my passion lay not
in wet-lab work or clinical medicine but in theoretical science—specifically, computational
approaches.
This led me to the Laboratory of Structure-Function Based Drug Design ([company]), where I
now pursue postgraduate studies in Bioinformatics and Mathematical Biology. My specialist diploma
research,”In Silico Drug-Drug Interaction Mechanism Prediction”, employed chemoinformatics-
drivenMLto predict molecular mechanisms, severity level and outcomes of drug combinations. That was
my first, authentic experience in Model Training (Naive Bayes Classifier), Cross-Validation (LOO-
CV), data scraping and preprocessing. We evaluated the accuracy of predictions with in vitro enzyme
activity bioelectrochemical assay for several drug pairs excluded from training data. A key innovation of
our approach is mechanism prediction for unsynthesized drugs, since the prediction itself is based solely
on chemical structures for drugs in a specific pair. You can try it here.
My PhD thesis, ”Analysis of Biological Effects of Drug Combinations Using Ensemble Machine Learning Models”, integrates something that we currently call ”Natural Language Module”
which combines:
• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
• Custom zero-shot Relation Extraction (RE)
• Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
This framework mitigates LLM hallucinations by grounding the text output in scientific literature,
clinical trials, manuals, guidelines and references, while also providing natural language explanations to
predictions of biological effects of specific drug combinations. While limited by computational resources,
collaborations with the Institute for Artificial Intelligence Problems ([company]) may soon enable
LLM fine-tuning and public deployment.
Though my post-PhD path (academia or industry) remains open, I aim for my work to contribute
meaningfully — to make, as grandiose as it sounds, ”a tribute to eternity.” My enthusiasm for generative
AI stems not from hype but from conviction in its long-term relevance.
Thank you for considering my motivation letter.
Yours sincerely
