Hello, this is [name] [surname]'s motivation letter!
Even at schoo l, physics and mathematics were easy subjects for me. I could qui ckly solve
problems of any compl exity and al ways get A's in these subjects. However, due to changes in the
worl d, especially in the legal field, I decided to study law and all related subjects. At the same
time, my interest in applied sciences did not fade, and I continued to study them in my free time.
My h usband, who studied robotics, often told me about his hobby. This was very interesting for
me, so after gra dua tion from the [compa ny], I plan to e nroll in a Master's degree
in Applied Robotics at [compa ny].
My h usband and I are c urrently working on projects related to the modernization of the
robotic promoter and the creation of an educational electronic construction kit for chi ldre n and
students. Our goal is to in stil in them interest in robotics. After completion of these projects, I plan
to develop my own project - the creation of a pr otective "dome" for factories and airports from
birds. Today, there is a serious problem with the interf erence created by birds for airp lane s during
tak eoff and landing, which poses a danger to public safety. In ad dition, many birds die in factories
where grain is pro cesse d. To solve this problem, I want to investigate machine learning more
deeply. My goal is to create a system that rec ognizes birds using a camera and deli berately scares
them away. For this, I intend to study at [compa ny] in order to improve my
skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Using the kn owl edge, I have gained, I will
create a project that will help to prevent many ac cidents and make p eople's lives safer.
