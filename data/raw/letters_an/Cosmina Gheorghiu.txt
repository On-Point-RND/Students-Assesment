Dear Selection Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am currentlly a third-year student at the Mechanics and
Mathematics Faculty of [location] [university]. I am writing to express my strong
interest in participating in the Summer Machine Intelligence Learning SchooL (SMILES-2025)
organized by [compaany] in collaboration with [compaany].
As a passionate researcher in the field of machine learning, I have dedicated myself to exploring
advanced topics such as neural networks, generative models, and natural language processing.
My coursework project focuses on analyzing the Tree Tagger method, which has deepened my
understanding of linguistic annotation techniques. Additionally, I am actively involved in
developing an educational platform that leverages machine learning to create personalized
learning paths for students based on their cognitive abilities and psychological profiles. This
project aligns closely with SMILES-2025â€™s emphasis on practical applications of AI technologies.
Participating in SMILES-2025 represents a unique opportunity for me to expand my technical
expertise, engage with leading experts in the field, and collaborate with talented peers from [location] and [location]. I am particularly excited about the hands-on workshops and hackathons,
where I can apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world challenges. Moreover, the cultural
exchange component of the program resonates deeply with my belief in fostering international
cooperation to drive innovation.
I firmly believe that SMILES-2025 will not only enhance my skills but also inspire me to pursue
ambitious projects that address global issues. By attending this summer schooL, I hope to gain
valuable insights into emerging trends in AI, connect with potential mentors and investors, and
contribute meaningfully to the development of transformative technologies.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to join this
prestigious program and make a positive impaact alongside fellow participants.
