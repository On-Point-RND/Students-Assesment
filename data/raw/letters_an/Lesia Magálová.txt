I strongly believe that my happiness in terms of my career — lies in becoming one of the top 0.01% of professionals in the field of machine learning engineering and research. My goal is to be someone who can easily and confidently collaborate with others to tackle the world’s most important problems in technology, society, and the global economy.
As a person, I feel truly happy when those around me are also happy — or at least have the tools to pursue happiness: financial stability, creative freedom, and their fundamental human needs met. The better I become as a professional, the more capacity and power I have to improve the lives of those around me — in small or large ways.
In search of the path where I can make the greatest positive impact, I’ve worked on diverse machine learning projects to gain broad experience and a deeper understanding of how the industry works, what different people and communities need, and what I can offer in return. I’ve worked in the competitive engineering environment ([company] Bauman Racing Team, where our main goal was to win year-end competitions), in a B2C startup ([company] Fast Food Meme, a personalized, infinite meme feed), and, most recently, as a researcher at [company] ISP RAS. In my current role, I’ve found deep fulfillment in the freedom to explore different approaches, experiment with models, and contribute to achieving new state-of-the-art results in select areas of machine learning (all details can be found at my CV/Linkedin/GitHub)
Looking ahead, my career plans over the next 7–9 years include completing a Master’s degree in Computer Science, followed by a PhD, and ultimately publishing an oral paper at a top-tier A* conference. I realize these are ambitious goals, and the only path to reaching even half of them is through long-term dedication, hard work, and collaboration with the best teammates — under the guidance of leading experts in the field.
At 20 years old, currently a 3rd [company] BMSTU undergraduate, I believe this is achievable. And one of the most important steps I can take now is participating in the Skoltech Summer School — learning alongside the peers who share similar goals, guided by top experts in machine learning. I’m happy about the chance to experience an intense crazy-good mix of theory and practice, including research, lectures, and hackathons that explore the advanced AI techniques. To go deeper and gain a more fulfilling experience, I want to become a SMILES volunteer and help make these days truly smooth and positive unforgettable.
I simply can’t miss such a powerful opportunity to move closer to my dream!!!
