Dear [name] Admissions Committee,
I am excited to apply for the [compaany] Summer School of Machine Learning (SMILES-2025),
as it presents a unique opportunity to deepen my knowledge of generative AI, collaborate
with talented researchers, and gain hands-on experience in cutting-edge machine learning
techniques. My academic background, prior projects, and career aspirations align closely
with the school’s focus, and I am eager to contribute to and learn from this intensive
program.
Generative AI has rapidly transformed the field of machine learning, enabling breakthroughs
in creative applications, multimodal systems, and autonomous agents. During my bachelor’s
studies, I explored these topics in coursework and projects, but I am now eager to transition
from applied implementations to research-driven innovation. SMILES-2025’s focus on
generative models and large language models (LLMs) resonates strongly with my interests.
The school’s blend of lectures, workshops, and hackathons will allow me to bridge
theoretical knowledge with practical challenges, which are precisely the skills I need to
advance in AI research.
Additionally, the international collaboration between [compaany] and the [compaany] is
particularly appealing. Working alongside peers from diverse academic
and cultural backgrounds will broaden my perspective and foster connections that could lead
to future research partnerships. The emphasis on networking and mentorship is invaluable
as I prepare for graduate studies and a career at the intersection of academia and industry.
My journey in ML/DL began during my bachelor’s degree, where I completed coursework in
algorithms, statistics, and neural networks. I further developed my skills through hands-on
projects. For my bachelor’s thesis, I am currently investigating the application of generative
models (such as GANs, diffusion models, and others) for satellite image super-resolution.
This project has deepened my interest in generative methods for computer vision and their
real-world applications.
Beyond my thesis work, I have experimented with language and multimodal models in
various academic projects. This includes fine-tuning smaller models (e.g., BERT, ruBERT,
GPT-2, and CLIP) for specific tasks like named entity recognition (NER) and information
retrieval. I have also worked with large pre-trained models, both open-source (such as Gemma) and proprietary (like ChatGPT), exploring few-shot learning techniques and data
augmentation strategies.
While these projects gave me practical experience, I now aim to shift toward more
research-oriented work, particularly in generative AI. SMILES-2025’s curriculum will provide
the structured learning and expert guidance I need to make this transition.
From SMILES-2025, I hope to gain a multifaceted experience that will significantly advance
my technical expertise, research network, and career trajectory. First and foremost, I aim to
deepen my understanding of cutting-edge generative AI methods, particularly diffusion
models, multimodal systems, and the latest advancements in large language models. The
school’s hands-on workshops and hackathons will provide the perfect environment to move
beyond theoretical knowledge and tackle real-world challenges, which is something I
consider essential for transitioning from applied projects to meaningful research.
Beyond technical growth, I am eager to engage with the school’s vibrant community of
researchers, professors, and industry professionals. Meeting like-minded peers who share
my enthusiasm for AI innovation could lead to future collaborations, whether in academic
projects, publications, or even startup ventures. The international nature of the program,
bridging Russian and Chinese expertise, is especially exciting, as it offers a unique chance
to exchange ideas across different research cultures and approaches.
Beyond academics, I would love to contribute to SMILES-2025 as a volunteer. As highlighted
in my CV, I contributed to the organization of the final stage of the National Technical
Olympiad. This experience taught me the value of teamwork and meticulous planning in
large-scale events. Volunteering at SMILES, whether through social activities, media
creation, or logistics, would allow me to give back to the community while strengthening ties
with peers and organizers. This hands-on involvement aligns perfectly with my goal of
immersive learning and networking.
Finally, I see SMILES-2025 as a critical step in shaping my professional future. The
mentorship from leading experts will help me refine my research direction, while networking
opportunities could open doors to internships, graduate programs, or entrepreneurial
endeavors. By the end of the program, I hope to emerge not only with stronger technical
skills but also with a clearer vision of how to turn AI research into impactful solutions -
whether in academia or in industry.
My immediate goal is to pursue a master’s degree in AI, likely at [compaany], where I can focus
on generative models and their industrial applications. Afterward, I aspire to work at the
intersection of science and business, either in an AI research lab or by founding a
science-intensive startup. The ability to translate cutting-edge research into scalable
solutions is crucial, and SMILES-2025’s industry-aligned challenges will help me develop
this mindset.
This summer school is more than a learning opportunity - it’s a stepping stone toward my
master’s studies and a chance to build a foundation for my career. The skills, connections,
and mentorship I gain will accelerate my growth as a researcher and innovator.
I am highly motivated to join SMILES-2025 and contribute to its collaborative environment.
My background in ML & DL, combined with my passion for generative AI, makes me a strong
candidate for the program. I am confident that this experience will propel me toward my
academic and professional goals while allowing me to engage meaningfully with the global
AI community.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to participate in
SMILES-2025.
Best regards,
