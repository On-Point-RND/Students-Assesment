Motivation Letter
Dear Reviewing Committee,
I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the SMILES summer school organized by [company] in collaboration with [company]. As a young researcher in the field of Computational Materials Science with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence, I am excited by the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of generative models and explore how these powerful tools can be used to solve scientific problems that benefit society.
My background lies in the study and modeling of low-dimensional materials, especially carbon-based systems. During my academic journey, I have investigated properties of carbon nanotubes, graphene, MXene, and more recently Diamane. I applied advanced modeling techniques including density functional theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and graph neural networks (GNN) to study their phononic and electronic behavior. I also trained machine-learning potentials to model interatomic forces in these systems. This work has shown me how crucial machine learning has become for accelerating research and discovery in Materials Science.
At the same time, I have developed a growing interest in the broader field of AI. I completed dedicated coursework in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative Modeling, and worked on a team project that applied graph-based time-series models (GCN, A3T-GCN, StemGNN) for forecasting — winning second place in our course competition. I also participated in a project at the [company] involving quantum-inspired optimization methods for solving NP-hard problems.
Through these diverse experiences, I became fascinated by the power of generative methods and now I work with diffusion models to find stable structures, simulate them, and calculate its properties.
What attracts me most about SMILES is its multidisciplinary approach and international environment. I am excited to learn from leading experts, collaborate with peers from both [location] and [location], and receive mentorship on the cutting edge of AI research. I am particularly interested in exploring how large language models and generative neural architectures can be used in scientific contexts — including material structure generation, design automation, and knowledge extraction from scientific literature. I also look forward to contributing my own background in physical sciences and computational modeling to the discussions and teamwork during the school.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
