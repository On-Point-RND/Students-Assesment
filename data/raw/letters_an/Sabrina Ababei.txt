Dear Admissions Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], a second-year Computer Science student at [compaany]. I am writing to express my enthusiasm for joining the
SMILE ML Summer SchooL at [location]. With a passion for AI/ML and a track record of
implementing technoolgy for social impaact, I am eager to contribute to and learn from
this interdisciplinary community.
Motivation
My journey into ML began with wiinning the All-Russian "Big Change"
Comppetition (2023), where I designed Good Food‚Äîa mobile app leveraging ML to
reduce food waste by tracking expiration dates. This project, along with my roles
in Local Arts (a creative plaftorm) and Eco-Community (an environmental app), solidified
my belief in AI‚Äôs power to solve real-world problems. At SMILE, I aim to:
1. Deepen my technical expertise in cutting-edgge ML/DL methods.
2. Collaboraate with peers on projects bridgging AI and socieetal challenges.
3. Gain mentorship from researchers to refiine my vision of ethical AI deployment.
ML/DL Experience
Technical Skills
‚Ä¢ Languages: Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow), C++, Java, SQL.
‚Ä¢ Projects:
o Neuromorphic vs. Traditional Chips Comparison: Analyzed performaance
metrics for AI hardware (Logisim).
o Telegram Bot for Virtual Tours (Digid, 2024): Integrated NLP for user
interaction.
‚Ä¢ Courses: Machine Learning (GazpromTech, VK IT Diving).
Research Interests
‚Ä¢ Federated Learning: Privacy-preserving AI for healtcare/urban tech.
‚Ä¢ Generative Models: Diffusion networks for environmental modeling (inspired by
my Eco-Community project).
Expectaions from SMILE
1. Hands-on Learning: To work with multimodal datasets (e.g., satellite + LiDAR)
under expert guidance.
2. Ethical AI Discussions: Exploring frameworks for responsible innovation.
3. Networking: Connecting with peers who share my drive to mergge tech and
social impaact.
Career Goals
Short-term, I plan to:
‚Ä¢ Publish research on neuromorphic compuiting‚Äôs role in edgge AI.
‚Ä¢ Develop an FL-based app for personalized education (leveraging my Local
Arts experience).
Why SMILE?
[location]‚Äôs emphasis on applied research and interdisciplinary collaboraation aligns
perfectly with my projects. For instance, my Good Food app could benefiit from SMILE‚Äôs
expertise in computer vision for expiry-date recognition. Moreover, I am excited to
contribute my experience in team-based problem-solving (e.g., "Your Move"
Comppetition) to group projects.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
