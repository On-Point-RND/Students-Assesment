Dear [name],
I am writing to express my strong interest in attending the SMILES Summer School. I am always looking for ways to grow my knowledge and skills in the field of machine learning, and this school is a great chance to stay updated on the latest methods, engage with top experts, and meet with researchers from diverse backgrounds. In the rapidly evolving field of AI, it is important to keep learning and exploring new ideas.
Joining this summer school would not only provide valuable academic insights but also offer a rich cultural exchange and opportunities to connect with the [compaany] and [compaany] community. I am particularly interested to explore how cultural differences influence research approaches and industry practices. Meeting and learning from experts of [location] is especially inspiring due to this country’s rapid technological growth and large AI community.
The topics offered this year are directly relevant to my interests and align closely with my academic and research background. During my bachelor’s and master’s studies, I have built a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science and progressed in the field of machine learning and deep learning. I am confident that my skills can help me address real-world industry challenges presented at this school and to also play a role in enhancing the overall school experience. Throughout my education, I actively engaged in several machine learning research projects that closely relate to the summer school's themes:
- In the field of Safe AI, my research project included exploring whether techniques from steganography, traditionally used for hiding information in images, could enhance the effectiveness of white-box gradient-based adversarial attacks. Specifically, I investigated whether applying stronger perturbations to regions invisible to the human eye could strengthen the impact of these attacks. Additionally, I analyzed how robust these attacks were against common defense methods, such as JPEG compression. This experience provided valuable insights into adversarial robustness and facilitated my interest in current advancements in this area.
- My second research direction focused on self-supervised learning techniques for pre-training convolutional neural networks. Initially, I participated in testing a rotation angle prediction pretext learning task, which showed promising results on simple, single-object datasets. Later I investigated contrastive self-supervised methods tailored for dense-prediction tasks—where labeling costs are high. I implemented the PixPro dense contrastive learning approach, adapting its training pipeline for high-resolution feature maps to support downstream applications like semantic segmentation and possibly active learning for semantic segmentation. This experience gave me valuable practical insights into self-supervised pre-training methods.
- I have also gained recent experience with Large Language Models and Agent-based systems in recommender engines. I participated in development of an evaluation framework for LLM-powered recommenders. This work included defining and systematizing how to inject LLMs into existing pipelines, and creating tools to run comparisons between methods and with traditional approaches. Our work also examined agent architectures as orchestration layers, equipping them with specialized tools to plan and execute each step of the recommendation workflow. This field continues to evolve and remains an active area of research.
- Additionally, I participated in conducting a systematic literature review of generative approaches in text-to-image generation. This work included analyzing and categorizing over fifty papers about popular in this field generative approaches (GANs, Diffusion models) and and their strategies for training to follow text prompts. This comprehensive overview gave me a strong foundation in generative modeling.
- I am also familiar with multi-modal approaches. At last year’s [compaany] Summer School, team was working on adapting the tiny LLaVA framework from vision to audio—updating the encoder, preparing audio datasets, and training new adapters. I look forward to continue exploring multimodal methods.
I expect the summer school to help me strengthen my theoretical foundations, gain practical experience with advanced methods, and build strong connections with researchers and fellow participants. The opportunity for cultural exchange and collaborative learning within an international community greatly appeals to me. I also hope to discover new research gaps—potential topics for future work—and to discuss ideas directly with experts.
My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of novel methods that drive innovation and solve critical industry challenges. Moreover, I see teaching and knowledge sharing as integral components of my career path and I consider continuing studying. Participating in the SMILES Summer School will help in achieving these goals by providing me with skills, knowledge, and networking opportunities.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of actively participating in and contributing to this summer school's community.
