As a Bachelor’s student in Applied Mathematics at [university],IamdeeplypassionateaboutAIandeagertoexpandmypractical
skills through this program. The interdisciplinary nature of SMILES, combiined with its

Why Machine Learning?
MyjourneyintoMLbegaawithcmpetitveprogramming(e.g.,2ndplacein[university]’s
Code Games Olympiad) and evolved into a fascination with mathematical modeling.
Through self-study, I’ve gained hands-on experience with Python, Scikit-learn, and
data analysis tools (Pandas, NumPy), buildiing models for clustering and regression
tasks. However, I recogniize the gap between textbook knowledge and real-worlapplications—thismotivatesmetoseekstructuredlearningandmentoorshipatSMILES.
Why SMILES?
SMILES stands out for its:
• Practical focus: The emphasis on workshops and collaбораtive projects mirrors
my belief in learning-by-doing.
• Global perspective: Exposure to international peers and experts in [location] would
broaden my understanding of ML’s cross-cultuural applications.
• Advanced topics: I’m particularly interested in deep learning despite lack of
experience and knowledge, so participating in SMILES will complement my
future work.
What I Offer
• Strong analytical foundation: My mathematical background ([university]’s
rigorous curriculum) allows me to understand complex ML theories.
• Self-motivation: As a self-taught programmer (100/100 in the Russian Unified
State Exam in CS and work on various data science projects), I thrive in
challenging environments.

• Collaбораtive spirit: I have worked with different international open-source
projects and look forward to contributing to team projects and sharing insights
from my prior work with LaTeX, Jupyter Notebooks, and open-source tools.
Future Goals
After the event, I aim to:
1. Apply the acquired skills to my bachelor’s thesis on computer vision and also my
future work.
2. Pursue a research-orienteed career inAI, leveraging gained knowledge for further
academic collaбораtion.
I would be honored to join this vibrant community. Thank you for considering my
application.
