Motivation Letter
[name] and [name] works as a Senior Data Scientist at [compaany]. Upon learning the main themes of the school this year, I realized this is a unique opportunity to deepen my knowledge and skills within the topics. Although my primary specialization at the company involves building credit scoring models, I actively seek out and participate in projects utilizing state-of-the-art machine or deep learning methods. For instance, our team developed a Vision-Language model for the automatic recognition and analysis of documents. Furthermore, we apply neural networks, including transformer-like architectures, for analyzing tabular data in credit risk assessment. My experience with PyTorch, Transformers and other ML libraries provides me with a solid technical foundation for mastering the school’s material.
My interest in deep learning extends far beyond my work responsibilities. I constantly follow the latest advancements in LLMs and generative models, regularly read scientific papers, and watch lectures and reviews on resources such as the ’[compaany]’ Telegram channel and the ’[compaany]’ YouTube channel. However, I feel that for further growth, I lack direct interaction with the academic community and the researchers shaping the forefront of the science.
Participation in the Summer of Machine Learning School by [compaany] is, for me, a chance to:
• Deepen understanding: Gain structured knowledge about the latest research in LLMs and generative models from leading experts.
• Establish contacts: Meet researchers, authors of breakthrough work, and like-minded individuals, and build valuable professional connections (networking).
• Find inspiration: Discuss my own research interest – the development of a ’switchable tokenizer’ that could potentially improve the quality and speed of text processing for multilingual by combining existing tokenizers. I would be glad to receive feedback and understand the prospects of this idea within the community.
• Explore career paths: The Summer School seems like an ideal platform for exploring future career opportunities specifically focused on Deep Learning and language models.
The fact that the school takes place in [location] – a country that is one of the world leaders in artificial intelligence research – is particularly appealing. The opportunity to immerse myself in this environment and learn where many state-of-the-art technologies are being created is incredibly motivating.
Thank you for considering my application, and I hope for the opportunity to join the Summer of Machine Learning School by [compaany].
Sincerely,
[name]
