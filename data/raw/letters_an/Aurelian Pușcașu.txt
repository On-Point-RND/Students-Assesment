Motivation Letter
Dear [name] Admissions Committee,
My name is [name] and I am writing to express my strong interest
in pursuing the SMILES-2025 summer school of machine learning in [location] [compaany]. I learned about this application opportunity from your email.
I am a master student in the educational programme " Chemistry and Artificial Intelligence" at [compaany], [location]. Independently, I had my own bachelor's degree in chemical engineering, I am now learning the ML and deep learning sphere.
I am applying for this summer work because it is organized by [compaany] and [compaany], which are recognized as the leaders in AI technologies and new approaches in [location]. In addition, a [compaany] scientist who taught a course during my academic year strongly recommended the summer school as a valuable opportunity to improve both hard and soft skills.
My scientific interests include the application of artificial intelligence methods in the fields of chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science and metallurgy. During the last two years I have attended several forums of large chemical technology companies: [compaany], [compaany] and [compaany]. During meetings with their IT specialists, it became clear that there is a strong interest in this field in developing an AI system that would allow companies to operate as a single unit. Multi-agent systems are a viable method for developing such architectures.
In addition, deep learning approaches, including large language models, can be used in the field of manufacturing chemistry. For example, [compaany] plans to use deep learning methods to develop new polymers with improved properties, bypassing the need for extensive long-term experimentation. The available evidence supports the following conclusion: it is essential to constantly acquire new approaches in your field of knowledge. This is the reason why I have started to learn applicable AI approaches in chemistry.
This academic year, I am participating in a scientific project on "Predicting the catalytic activity of Cu-based catalysts" as the main experimenter. Our goal is to develop an algorithm to help scientists design an efficient catalyst to solve the CO2 recycling problem. I received a scholarship to attend the Advanced Engineering School to develop this scientific project, which is an intermediate achievement. In this project, we are using a combination of classical ML, deep learning and quantum chemical calculations to obtain the best metrics with further laboratory testing. Another way to modify our research is to use additional deep learning approaches to get better catalyst descriptions.
In addition, I am currently working with a digital department of the mining company "[compaany]" to solve a text classification task. My task will be to develop a module of extraction of the subject of compliance in the technical report. There I also use NLP tools to achieve better metrics with the requirement of local model inference.
During my educational year, I have also taken part in several hackathons with chemistry-related themes ([compaany], [compaany] HACKATHON and [compaany]) with my group mates (you probably already have their cool applications!). It gives me the experience of working in a team and learning new skills in a short period of time. For example, I studied the use of transformer architecture in chemical tasks and generative approaches to create new molecules with specified properties.
I strongly believe that this summer school will provide me with the opportunity to expand my knowledge of modern topics in deep learning, including generative models, multimodal methods, large language models, and multi-agent systems. I am interested in attending lectures by scientists from different areas of AI, as this will allow me to broaden my knowledge base.
Upon completion of the summer programme, I intend to refine my scientific methodologies and apply the acquired knowledge to my professional endeavors. After graduation, I plan to become a specialist in applicable AI in chemistry and help industry solve their needs in developing AI methods.Thank you for considering my application.
Your sincerely,
[name]
Masterâ€™s Student, Chemistry and AI, [compaany]
