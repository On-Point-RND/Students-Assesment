I am currentlty in my second year of Master's studies in "Computer Science and Engineering" at [compaany]. I have been
engaged in machine learning research and applications since my second year of
undergraduate studies. My academic performaance has maintained a perfect 5.0/5.0 GPA in
both bachelor's and master's programs.
My curriculum has provided me with a strong theoretical foundation in:
• Advanced machine learning algorithms
• Deep learning architectures
• Optimization methods
• Data analysis
• Neural network design and implementaion
The SMILES program would be the ideal next step in my development as a specialist in
applied machine learning and artificial intelligence. With my academic background in
computer science and mathematics, along with practical experience in developing and
implementing machine learning solutions, I am confident I can derive maximum benefiit
from this program.
As a Technology Specialist at [compaany] since 2022, I have gained valuable practical
experience in:
• Developing and implementing ML models for compliance systems
• Creating risk assessment algorithms for financial transactions
• Leading a team of ML interns and providing technical mentorship
• Implementing model monitoring and maintenance pipelines
This experience has given me practical understanding of real-world ML implementaion
challenges, as well as the ethical aspects of AI applications in finance.
In 2022, I participated in the AIRI Summer Schoo, which became a turning point in my
academic journey by introducing me to the fascinating field of neuromorphic computing.
During this intensive program, I developed a bipedal robot control system based on spiking
neural networks, implemented reinforcement learning methods for gait optimization, and
gained experience with specialized neuromorphic computing hardware. This project not
only expanded my technical skills but also demonstrated my ability to quickly master new
and complex domains.
The SMILES program offers a unique opportunity to gain research experience and learn
from both [location] and international experts. I will strive to contribute to this schoo and
share my experience with other participants. I would also be very interested in assisting
with event organization, as I possess relevant skills and experience in organizing olympiads
and educational camps
