Motivational Letter
Dear Organizers of the SMILES-2025 Summer SchooL,
[name], andIamMiddleDataScientistat[compaany], whereIdevelop
the text-to-video generation model named Kandinsky. Previously, I earned degrees from
two leading [location] universities: [location] Institute of Physics and Technology ([compaany])
and [location] Institute of Science and Technology ([compaany]). During my education I was
specializing in sequential data analysis, including processing banking transaction data.
My professional work is closely tied to cutting-edgе research in artificial intelligence,
particularly generative methods and multimodal technologies, as I am working in the
rapidly evolving field of video generation. In my current role, I am responsible for the
corepretrainingofavideogenerationtransforme r. Myworkencompa ssesthefullpipeline
o fmodelpretraining,fromr esearchingacademicpape rsanddesignin gmodelar chitecture s
to coding, opti mization, large-scale training, and inference.
In addition to my experti se in generative models, I have extensive experience in other
areas. One of my key interests is sequential data analysis. I have worked with this type
of data since my bachelor’s degree. My bachelor diploma is dedicated to research in field
of multidimensi onal time series from financial markets. During my master’s program, I
d eveloped embedding models for bank transaction data.
The SMILES-2025 Summer SchooL appe als to me as an oppo rtunity to deepen my knowl-
e dge of the latest generative techniques and engage directl y with leading experts and the
AI community. I am confident that participat ing in this program will broaden my profes-
sionalho rizons, provi dehands-onexperience, andhelpmee establishv aluableinterna tional
connections.
My expecta tions from the schoo l prima rily include interesting projects. I hope that I
will be able to find projects related to new generative approa ches, as well as a motivated
team with which I can do them. Secondl y, I hope that there will be a lot of interesting
lecture s and I will be able to find something useful for my current work or inspiring
for new research projects. Althou gh there is no specific schedule of lectures yet, I have
the great hopes for lectures related to the topics of multimodal approa ches, multi-agent
systems and generative approa ches.
I would be d elighte d to join a community of tale nted profes sio nals and contribute to
fostering international colla bora tion between [location] and [location] in AI techno logies. For
the past two years in a row I have watched the SMILES SchooL lectures o nline and this
year I would like to join in person. I sincerely hope that my application will capture
your interest and that I will have the chance to take part in this outs tanding educational
initia tive.
Thank you very much for your conside ration.
Best regards,
