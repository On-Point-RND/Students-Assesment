Motivation Letter for SMILES
My name is [name], and I am actively involved in machine learning and NLP,
particularly large language models. My interest in this field stems not only from
ideological considerations, as I believe these models have the potential to
significantly improve human life, but also from professional motivations. All of my
projects (work-related, academic, and scientific) are in some way connected to
machine learning models, which is why I see this school as an opportunity for
both personal and career growth.
I am currently writing a scientific paper on the use of RAG for searching scientific
articles. I am also developing a RAG system to simplify information retrieval in
scientific papers. Furthermore, I have completed a bootcamp on RAG, so I am
particularly keen to enhance my skills in the areas of knowledge storage and
decision-making for large language models. The topic of logical reasoning in
language models also interests me.
In addition, I am interested in audio processing models (which are also relevant to
some of my projects), and I would like to develop my expertise in this area as well.
The field of safe AI is also of interest to me for ideological reasons.
Last year, I participated in SMILES 2024 and won third place in the project
competition. This experience provided a significant boost to my development in
the field of ML, and I am eager to repeat it.
