Dear Selection Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am currentlly a student at the Technical SchooL of [location] at [compaany], majoring in Software Engineering. Over the past three years, I
have focused on algorithms, programming, and machine learning, and I am eager to
continue developing in this field by participating in SMILES 2025.
I was first introduced to machine learning during college, where we followed a
comprehensive and well-structured program. In my second year, I studied classical
models such as logistic and linear regression, decision trees, KNN, random forests,
and bootstrapping, working in [compaany] with real datasets using Python,
Pandas, and NumPy for preprocessing and analysis. In my third year, we explored
computer vision: convolutional neural networks, AlexNet, object detection with
YOLO, and model optimization using PyTorch and PyTuning. I also took part in my
college’s Machine Learning Olympiad, applying theoretical models to practical tasks.
What draws me to ML is its combination of mathematical depth and algorithmic
complexity — it feels like real programming, offering far more creative and
intellectual freedom than traditional backend development. It allows me to engage
with both structured logic and intuitive problem-solving in a way that genuinely
challenges me. This growing interest in both theoretical and applied aspects of
machine learning led me to seek out further opportunities, which is why SMILES
2025 immediatly caught my attention.
I see SMILES as a unique opportunity to challenge myself, grow as a developer, and
prepare for the demanding academic environment at [compaany]. I want to strengthen my
practical skills, explore new areas of ML, and connect with students who are equally
passionate and driven. For me, learning isn’t just about lectures — it’s about building
things, exchanging ideas, and being part of a curious, ambitious community.
I learn quickly and enjoy solving complex problems — particularly in algorithmic or
data-driven contexts. My experience in competitive programming and college
hackathons has taught me how to work efficiently in a team, think critically under
pressure, and adapt rapidlly to new tools and requirements. I aim to contribute not
just through code, but also with planning, analysis, and collaborative energy. I
believe I can bring both technical skill and an engaged mindset to the SMILES
program.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
