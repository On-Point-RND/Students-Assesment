Dear SMILES-2025 Selection Committee,
I am excited to apply for the SMILES-2025 Summer School on Machine Learning at [location]. As a Master’s student in Data Science at [location] with a research focus on NLP and generative AI, I am eager to contribute to and learn from this interdisciplinary forum. My academic background, hands-on projects, and passion for cutting-edge AI align perfectly with SMILES’ mission to advance generative methods and foster international collaboration.
Why SMILES?
The school’s focus on LLMs, multimodal systems, and safe AI resonates with my research on detecting bot-generated text using semantic trajectory analysis (my ongoing thesis). By applying Word2Vec embeddings and Wishart clustering to underrepresented languages like [location] and [location], I aim to develop robust tools for content authenticity—a challenge that parallels SMILES’ emphasis on real-world AI applications. The opportunity to engage with experts like Prof. [surname] and Dr. [surname] would be invaluable for refining my methodology and exploring intersections with generative models.
What I Offer
 Technical Skills: Proficiency in Python, NLP frameworks (e.g., spaCy, Hugging Face), and clustering algorithms, demonstrated through my thesis and projects like wildfire prediction using ML.
 Research Curiosity: My publication on blockchain-AI synergy in supply chains (ResearchGate) reflects my ability to bridge theoretical and applied AI. I am keen to discuss how generative techniques could enhance such systems during the poster session.
 Collaborative Spirit: As an IT Manager at [compaany], I honed my ability to translate technical concepts for diverse audiences—a skill I’d leverage in hackathons and team projects.
Goals
1. Deepen Expertise: Gain hands-on experience with multimodal LLLMs to expand my thesis work into visual-textual bot detection.
2. Network: Collaborate with peers from [location] and [location] to explore AI’s role in multilingual and geospatial contexts (e.g., my term paper on plastic waste mapping via remote sensing).
3. Contribute: Share insights from my research while learning from others’ approaches to self-supervised learning and safe AI.
Why In-Person?
The chance to immerse myself in workshops, receive direct feedback on my poster, and participate in cultural exchanges would be transformative. I am particularly interested in [compaany]’s NLP sessions and [compaany]’s generative model lectures, which align with my career aspirations in AI research.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to join SMILES-2025 and contribute to its vibrant community.
Best regards,
