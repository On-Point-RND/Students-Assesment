Dear [name] selection committee,
I first got into machine learning during my bachelor’s at [compaany], in a
place and on a program unrelated to machine learning. In fact, my BSc university seems to have been
one of the few common [location] universities without an explicit connection to the data science
industry at the time. I didn't have any connections in data science or a name, only the unique
opportunities provided by the undergraduate olympiads. Nevertheless, I hoped to work in the top AI
research lab one day. Through online courses, the successful experience of ML competitions, DS
internships, master's degree in the top [location] university, many personal and team ML projects, and
collaborations, it became eventually possible.
Today, I’m an intern research scientist at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (AIRI), where I
work on machine unlearning for diffusion models using sparse autoencoders. In simple terms, I help
text-to-image models “forget” certain concepts or styles - so they won’t generate harmful, biased, or
copyrighted images. Ultimately, this helps the model’s owner to not lose money. The difficulty is that
one cannot simply retrain the diffusion model from zero, it is just too expensive, excluding the
inappropriate content from training data. Furthermore, talking about adult content in the diffusion
model’s training data, filtering it out has been associated, by community, with the impaired model’s
ability to generate human anatomy (link).
My work project sits at the intersection of AI safety, multimodal learning, generative AI and
interpretability. This is why I want to hear lectures and communicate with, specifically, [name] on
safe AI, and [name] on multimodality, which are the topics I am working on. It is especially
conducive for growing as a research scientist to have such materials from the top people in research
and industry. Additionally, I am seeking international experience and a good time working on a small
hypothesis during the hackathon with the best people, you are carefully selecting. In any case, it is
great luck to meet professor [name] in person and ask him a question. Seriously, one rarely sees
him anywhere, even in [location] or AIRI.
Looking ahead, I plan to continue my work in AI research over the next three years as I pursue my
PhD, deepening my contributions to safety, interpretability, and generative models. Participation in
SMILES-2025 would be an invaluable step toward these goals - offering world-class instruction,
international collaboration, and inspiration from leaders in the field and passionate young researchers.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
With regards,
