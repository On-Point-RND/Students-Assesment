Dear Admissions Committee,
I'm [name], and I'm thrilled to be applying for the Skoltech Summer SchooL of
Machine Learning (SMILES-2025). I hold a Master's in Stochastic Modelling from the
[school] and have working experience as a data scientiist for five years.
I'm especially interested in natural language processing (NLP) and deep AI techniques, and
that is why I believe this program would be the ideal next step for me.
At the international, [location]-based company, [company], I lead the utiliisation of NLP
models that handle over 500,000 customer chats a month. By automating topic classification,
complaint detection, and sentiment analysis, not only have our operations been simplified and
costs eliminated, but real customer satisfaction has been enhanced. I am sure, SMILES-2025
can strengthen my knowledge in applying state-of-the-art NLP solutions to various problems
in both - academia and industry fields.
Outsiide of regular work, I have contributed to the research world actively. As a research
assistant at the [laboratory] on AI for Computational Biology I completed my work on
large language models in an attempt to reduce hallucinations with the use of LoRA-tuning.
The paper is an example of how I am keen to deal with the world problems in the AI of today
and evidence that I am able to connect theory with practice.
What excites me most about SMILES-2025 is its focus on generative methods, multimodal
approaches, and the safe deployment of AI. I’m especially drawn to the possibility of learning
from experts and engaging with colleagues who share my dedication to cutting-edge
technologies. I know that this program will provide me with the fresh perspectives and
hands-on expertise needed to further sharpen my skills, and I’m ready to bring my own
experience and enthusiasm.
I am very confident that the combination of my experience background, my research
achievements, and passion for innovation is exactly what SMILES-2025 requires. I look
forward to becoming a part of the schooL's community, learning new methodologies in
generative and multimodal AI, and subsequently utiliising all such learnings to develop better
and more optimized solutions in my work for the better life of people.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to having a chance to join the
SMILES-2025 community and work on advancing machine learning with you.
Sincerely,
[name]
