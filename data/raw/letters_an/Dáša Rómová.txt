To the organizers of the Skoltech Summer School of Machine
Learning (SMILES-2025)
My name is [name], and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the [compaany] for Cognitive Modeling at the [compaany], with a focus on reinforcement learning (RL), deep learning and cognitive
architectures. My academic journey has been consistently shaped by my interest in
understanding intelligence through the lens of computational modeling, and I am
particularly passionate about model-based reinforcement learning and self-supervised
representation learning.
Previously, I worked as a junior researcher at the [compaany] at [location], where I was involved in applied machine learning projects across diverse fields.
I developed a clustering algorithm for passive radar signals based on DBSCAN and
designed a sensor fusion system (UWB/IMU/Kalman) for robust mobile robot
localization in GPS-denied environments. As an alternative approach to sensor fusion, I
applied visual odometry techniques based on computer vision, including Haar cascades
and YOLO. I also explored RNN-based methods for neural source localization from
M/EEG data. These projects gave me a solid foundation in signal processing, machine
learning and probabilistic modeling.
In my current work, I focus on object-centric model-based RL, where the agent
perceives the world not as raw pixels, but as compositions of dynamic, interacting entities
- objects. This approach provides clear advantages in generalization, interpretability and
sample efficiency—especially in visually complex or partially observable environments.
Crucially, this line of research relies heavily on advances in self-supervised learning: to
build world models, the agent must learn compact, meaningful representations of
sensory inputs without access to dense supervision. I believe that the future of RL lies in
tight integration with these domains.
I am deeply motivated to participate in SMILES-2025 for several reasons. First and
foremost, I am enthusiastic about the school’s focus on generative models, self-
supervised methods, and large language models, which I believe will play a
foundational role in the next wave of reinforcement learning research — especially in robotics. My
long-term goal is to build agents that can learn compact, generalizable models of the
world using self-supervised signals from rich modalities such as video, text, and audio.
The ability to reason, plan, form memory, and adapt in a human-like manner is, in my
view, inseparable from the so-called world model problem — that is, the challenge of
constructing rich, structured internal representations of the environment that support
predictive and counterfactual thinking. Generative models are essential for simulating
possible futures and modeling uncertainty, allowing agents to plan and generalize
beyond direct experience. Self-supervised learning offers a scalable path to building
structured perceptual representations from unlabeled data, while large language models
introduce powerful priors over abstract knowledge, sequence understanding, and goal
inference. Together, these methods form the backbone of intelligent behavior that is
grounded in an internal model of the world. In this regard, I am convinced that solving
the world model problem — creating effective, general-purpose environment models —
is central to advancing RL, more so than refining existing policy optimization techniques.
Looking ahead, I aim to combine careers in both academic research and industrial
R&D. I hope to continue exploring foundational questions in machine learning,
particularly those that bridge the gap between perception, cognition, and decision-
making. I believe that participating in SMILES-2025 will provide me with both the
conceptual tools and practical experience to contribute meaningfully to these domains.
Moreover, SMILES-2025’s international and collaborative setting is of great importance
to me as an aspiring scientist. I am convinced that modern AI research must be global
and interdisciplinary by nature. Engaging with peers and mentors from both [location] and
[location] will broaden my perspective, introduce me to new methodologies, and allow me
to build connections that are essential for a successful academic and research-oriented
career. The combination of cutting-edge lectures, hands-on workshops, and real-world
challenges makes this school a rare and valuable opportunity.
Thank you for considering my application.
