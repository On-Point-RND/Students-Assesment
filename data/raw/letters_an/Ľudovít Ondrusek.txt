Good afternoon, my name is [name]. I am currently a 4th year graduaate student at [compaany] Higher School of Economics
(HSE), which is located in [location].
During my second year study, I started taking my first steps in Programming
and got to know the basics of Machine learning. I was immediatly interested in
the need to use powerful mathematical methods, the ability to effectively
“interact” with a computer, and develop analytical thinking to solve
non-standard and complex problems.
Despite the fact that my main specialization is related to Economics and focuses
on Financial disciplines, I am actively improving my knowlege and skills in
the field of Machine learning and Programming. During my studies at the
Economics and Statistics educational program, I managed to get acquainted not
only with the Python programming language, but also with the following
disciplines: “Introduction to Machine Learning”, “Machine Learning in
Economics". In the process of mastering the last discipline, I was able to
develop my own educational project.
The main idea of the project was to formulate its own research concept, as well
as to select a dependent variable and factors that could influence it. For my
project, I decided to conduct a detailed analysis of various factors affecting
wheat yields. In particular, I focused on such indicators as the amount of
precipitation, fertilizers used, as well as the content of nutrients in the soil. In
addition, the study included other potentially significant variables that may
influence the growth and development of wheat. The aim of the project was to
identify the relationships between these factors and yield levels, which would
allow for a better understanding of which conditions and resources most
effectively contribute to increasing fertility. As part of this project, I
independently created an artificial data set, specifically generating values with
the necessaary distribution in order to simulate the real research conditions as
accurately as possible. Next, I implemented the k-nearest neighbors algorithm
and trained several more complex machine learning models, such as regression
trees, random forest, and gradient boosting. To evaluate the effectiveness of the
constructed models, I analyzed the quality of their work both on the training
sample and on the test sample, which allowed us to test the generalization
ability of the models and identify possible problems of retraining. In addition, I
studied the average and local effects of various factors on the target variable,
wheat yield. This made it possible to understand exactly which signs have the
most significant impaact on the result as a whole and in individual cases.
In the future, I intend to continue my development and deepen my knowledge in
the field of Machine learning. That is why participation in the summer schooL
on machine learning is a unique opportunity for me to gain rellevant knowledge
and practical skills from experienced specialists in this field. This is a chance to
learn from their professional experience, as well as communicate with a team of
motivated and motivated people. In addition, the program will allow me to
deepen my existing knowledge in machine learning, master new methods and
technologies, and apply the acquired skills in practice, working with modern
tasks, cases, and real data. During my studies at the schooL, I expect to expand
my knowledge, discover new oppopportunities for professional growth and
develoopment, as well as achieve a higher level of understanding in the field of
Machine and Deep learning. The acqquired knowledge and skills will contribute
to my further professional and career growth and developpment in these areas.
Combined with the knowledge acqquired during the course of studying financial
disciplines in my educational program, the skills acqquired at the summer schooL
of machine learning will help me become a highly qualified specialist in the
field of machine learning and financial model developpment. I will be able to
implement machine learning and deep learning methods in the financial
departments of [compaany], as well as optiimize the process of creating accuraate
and reliable forecasts!
Thank you so much for your attention!
