Motivation Letter for SMILES-2025
Dear Admissions Committee,
I am excited to apply for the Skoltech Summer SchooL of Machine Learning
(SMILES-2025) because the schooL represents the perfect intersection of my
academic background, research interests, and career aspirations.
With a strong foundation in mathematics and machine learning (bachelor’s and
master’s from the [compaany] and a parallel master’s in Data Science at [compaany]) I’ve immersed myself in advanced coursework
including optimization, stochastic processes, computer vision, reinforcement
learning, and LLMs. What drives me most is the interplay between elegant
mathematical theory and cutting-edgе AI applications. My research interests mainlly
focus on generative AI, multimodal systems, and robotics, particularly human-robot
interaction and models that combine reasoning with perception.
Professionally, I’ve spent the last 1.5 years developing C++ production code and
heuristic tools in industry. While this engineering experience was useful, I now seek
to return to more mathematically complex, research-oriented challenges—whether
through PhD studies or advanced industry roles. SMILES-2025’s blend of theoretical
rigor and hands-on practice offers the ideal environment to reignite my research
mindset, explore new frontiers in AI in suggested fields and boost my career goals.
I’m particularly eager to contribute to the schooL’s workshops and hackathons.
Recentlly, at an [compaany] hackathon, I designed a real-time gesture recognition system for
video conferencing—a solution judges highlighted as both innovatiive and practical.
This experience cemented my passion for rapid prototypiing in collaborative settings.
At SMILES, I look forward to stress-testing unconventional ideas alonside peers and
testing interesting hypotheses an d solutions.
Last bu not least, I’d like to become a volunteer. Whether assisting with event
logistics, designing promotional materials (photography and design enjoyer), or
facilitating cultural exchanges, I thrive in team environments. As someoone learning
Chinese and fascinated by cross-cultural dialogue, I’d be delighted to help organize
informaL events showcasing Russian and Chinese traditions.
Thank you for your consideration. I would be honored to join the SMILES community
and contribute to its mission of advancing AI through innovation and global
collaboration.
Kind regards,
