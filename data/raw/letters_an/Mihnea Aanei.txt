Hello!
I am a third-year student at [location] Higher School of Digital Technologies in [location], specializing in "Artificial Intelligence and Programming." I decided back in high school that I wanted to become a programmer, although at the time it was a rather general idea, since our field includes many different areas. After enrolling in a program related to AI, I realized that this is the field in which I want to develop my skills and become a sought-after specialist.
During the summer after my second year, I completed a major project as part of my industrial internship. I worked on a postal correspondence distribution service — a classification task in machine learning. Using a machine learning library such as scikit-learn, I was able to select ML models and obtain predictions for class labels. The Optuna library helped automatically tune hyperparameters and choose the best-performing models. I also used libraries like pandas and numpy for data processing.
The internship taught me how to build an ML system from scratch — from data collection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. I learned how to apply feature engineering techniques and assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, while also checking for overfitting. In addition to building models, I had to implement text processing techniques, since the source data consisted of unstructured letter content that needed to be transformed into a machine-readable format. To achieve this, I studied NLP methods including tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming using libraries such as NLTK and spaCy, stop word removal, as well as text vectorization.
Currently, I am the team lead on a project titled "Analysis and Predictive Analytics of Specific Sectors and Indicators of the [location] Region." In this project, we are developing AI models to generate relevant forecasts for various economic indicators across different sectors, such as construction or investment. The project has an official client — the Department of Economics of the [location] Region. The indicators we work with are time-dependent data, which makes this an AI forecasting task — predicting future values based on historical data. To solve this problem, we plan to use various approaches, including classical time series models, machine learning methods, neural network models, and AutoML solutions. The solution architecture includes storing datasets for each indicator in a data lake, preprocessing them, selecting suitable models, evaluating model performance using metrics such as MAPE, MSE, and R², and presenting high-quality forecasts in an interpretable format. The system will also support logic for retraining models on new data, added according to predefined requirements. The project’s technology stack includes Apache Airflow for pipeline automation, Apache Superset for dashboarding and analytics, PostgreSQL for data storage, MLflow to manage the 1
model lifecycle, FastAPI for deployment, and Evidently AI to monitor data drift, which is crucial for assessing model health over time.
This semester, I also took part as a team leader in the All-Russian case championship "ProTsifra" on the topic "Development of a Service for Bill Splitting in Restaurants." The task was to develop a service that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to automatically extract data from a paper restaurant receipt and suggest convenient ways to split the bill among participants. For the OCR technology, we used Tesseract, which provided the highest accuracy for Russian-language receipts. To structure heterogeneous data into a JSON format suitable for further system processing, we used a large language model — GigaChat.
The summer school program covers modern approaches to machine learning that shape the development of AI. Large language models have already become an integral part of many people’s daily lives. I am particularly interested in the principles behind how LLMs work, their architecture, and generative approaches — all of which I had a chance to apply during the case championship, where I used LLMs for text processing. Deepening my knowledge in multimodal systems will help me learn how to effectively combine textual, graphical, and temporal data in analytical solutions. At the same time, the topic of safe AI is becoming a key requirement in product development. Self-supervised learning methods are used to build adaptive systems, which is something I plan to apply in my project with the Department of Economics. By studying these topics, I will gain not only theoretical knowledge but also hands-on experience with tools that are currently used by leading companies and research centers.
Your program will allow me to structure and reinforce the knowledge I have gained at university, as well as the practical skills that will help me move from solving basic tasks with ready-made LLM integrations to developing complex intelligent systems.
My experience in classical machine learning, natural language processing, and project management — combined with your program — will enable me to become a highly sought-after specialist capable of creating innovative solutions.
Participating in your school will give me the opportunity to collaborate with experts and like-minded individuals who will support and accelerate my professional growth.
In the long term, this school will help me contribute to the development of responsible and effective AI.
Sincerely,
