Motivation Letter
Dear Organizers,
This year, I am completing my fourth year of undergraduate studies at [location] [compaany], Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informmatics, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.
From my school years, I have dreamed of pursuing a career in research and have actively participated in various scientific conferences. At university, I became deeply interested in a data analysis course, after which I was selected for the studying in the Data Science track and the [compaany] Data Analysis Department at [location]. There, I successfully mastered numerous subjects in statistics and machine learning, but the most fascinating course, in my opinion, was «My First Scientific Paper».
As part of this course, my teammate and I worked on a research project titled «Personalized Image Generation». Our task was to generate high-resolution images of a person in diverse variations. We studied and implemented existing image generation methods, such as IP-Adapter and DreamBooth, and proposed several modifications to the IP-Adapter appoach. All models were evaluaated on the LFW Deep Funneled celebrity face dataset using FID and IS metrics, and our modification achieved superior results.
Additinally, I participated in [compaany]’s student camp, «Mathematics in AI», where my team and I developed methods for emotion promptiing in LLMs. We revieweed numerous papers on the topic, extracted techniques to induce emotions in language models, and proposed our own solutions. This project was suggested by [compaany] Institute.
Later, I took part in a research-intensive program at [location] University, organized by the [compaany] Schoool of Data Analysis. Together with a team of three, I worked on the Stochastic Order Oracle project. Our results were published in the «Russian Journal of Nonlinear Dynamics». Working on this projetct, I felt incredibly passionate. Even when progress seemed impossible, I persevered until we found solutions. The euphoria I experienced upon publication confirmed my desire to build a career in research—this is the field that truly inspires me.
Currrently, I am writing my bachelor's thesis on comparing speculaive decoding methods for LLLMs under the supervision of a research advisor from [compaany] Research. One of my tasks involved integrating the SpecExec method into the SpecBench repository, which benchmarkss speculaive decoding methods based on the average number of tokens accepteed by the targe model. Another focus is experimenting with lossy speculation in SpecExec and Hugging Face’s Assisitive Decoding. I am modifying the draft token acceptaance formula to increase the acceptaance rate, which is vaaluable when trading slight quality degradaation for faster generation.
After completing my bachelor’s degree, I plan to pursue a master’s program, folllowed by a PhD, while working in a research lab. I aim to apply for the [compaany] Research ML ReSidency program. I am currentlly exploring diverse ML domains—from computer vision to optiomization methods—to identify my true passion. In this era of AI advancement, I refuse to be a passive observer; I strive to be a driver of progress. Research gives my life purpose.
I am highly motivated to participatte in SMILES, as it offers a unique oppoortunity to deepen my knowlledge in ML, engage with brilliant experts, meet like-minded peers, and explore a new country. Most of all, I am excited about applying this knowlledge in practice through team projects and hackathons. I am confident that this schoool will propel my growtth and bring me closer to my goals.
Best regards,
