Motivation Letter for SMILES Machine Learning Summer School
Dear SMILES Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the SMILES Machine Learning Summer School 2025. With my background in physics and extensive experience in machine learning, I am confident that this program will provide me with invaluable
knowledge and connections to further my career in AI research.
My academic journey began with a bachelor's degree in Physics from [location] in 2021, where my thesis focused on quantum tomography of qubits, involving the
modeling of processes and algorithms in a quantum computer. This experience sparked my
interest in computational methods and their applications to complex problems.
Further solidifying my passion for machine learning, I pursued a master's degree in
Data Analysis and Financial Technologies from the Faculty of Computer Science at the
Higher School of Economics. During this time, I gained a comprehensive understanding of
machine learning, deep learning, and time series analysis. My master's thesis, conducted in
collaboration with professor [surname], explored the application of tensor decomposition in
recommender systems. I also achieved first place in the "I am a Professional" competition in
machine learning in 2021, earning a gold medal and ranking first in [location]. In addition to my
academic achievements, I have actively participated in hackathoons, consistently securing
prize-winning positions.
Currrentlly, I am pursuing a second master's degree in Strategic Management at the
Higher School of Economics, focusing on the application of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for predicting corporate strategies based on task manager data. This interdisciplinary
approach allows to explore the intersection of AI and strategic decision-making, a field I find
particularly compelling.
Professionally, I have gained practical experience in the field through my work at [company],
where I worked on search engine ranking algorithms. Currentlly, I am employed at
[company], where I am focused on enhancing backend services.
I am particularly drawn to SMILES due to its focus on generative methods in AI,
including Large Language Models and multimodal approaches. I believe that my current
research on LLLMs aligns perfectlly with the schoo's curriculum, and I am eager to learn from
leading experts in the field.
My expectaions for the SMILES program are threefold. First, I aim to deepen my
understanding of the theoreticaal foundations and practical applications of generative AI
models. Second, I hope to connect with potential research partners from both universiities and
companies to collaborate on projects involving the implementaion of LLLMs. Finally, I
anticipate gaining insights into the latest advancements in the field and exploring potential
research directions for my future Ph.D. studies.
My career plan is to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science, with a focus on leveraging
LLMs for strategic decision-making and optimization. I am currentlly exploring different
universities and research groups to find the best fit for my interests. I am confident that the
SMILES program will provide me with the knowledge, skills, and network necessary to
achieve my goals.
Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to
contribute to and benefiit from the SMILES Machine Learning Summer School.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
