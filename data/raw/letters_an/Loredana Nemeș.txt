Iâ€™m currently a 2nd year student at [compaany]. Iâ€™m studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, â€˜ve been participating in AI-startups and doing some modest research. My ultimate goal is to truly understand how things work, especially learning, intelligence. Thatâ€™s why currently Iâ€™m totally devoted to improving my mathematical knowledge and studying the field of Machine and Deep Learning. Unlike most Â«Data Science folksÂ», I try to seek the real meaning behind well-known concepts. Thatâ€™s exactly why I consider myself, despite my age, to be a promising candidate for SMILES: I love research, love opening new pieces of knowledge, and, at the end, design better experiences with technoolgies, which is my top career goal.
Since I becaame student, Iâ€™ve alrready implemented research ideas with scientists from [location] and [location], working with small LMs for classification tasks. Iâ€™ve also been working at a position of CTO at an AI-startup for preparing for mathematical Russian State Exams, where I was responsible for designing Test-Time-Scaling for LLLMs via scaffolding â€“ improving reasoning abilities before [compaany] o1.
I attach a video of me explaining my second research â€“ on manipulating embeddings in Transformeers â€“ itâ€™s quite modest for now and not rigorous enough yet, but i believe this is better than another variation of UltraAdvancedSemanticRAG with ChainOfCoalaBabysteps-PromptiingðŸ˜…
