Why I want to participate in Smiles 2025 - summer schoo
of machine learning
Dear Committee,
Nowadays, the automation of rock analysis constiutes a pivotal yet time-consuming
task within the domains of [location], [location], and [location]. My current PhD research is centered on the
detection and characterization of rock discontinuities (fracture) using advanced machine
learning and computer vision techniques. I have developed a pipeline based on the Segment
Anything model (SAM) with no additional fine-tuning and a set of computer vision filteers,
which allows to detect and characterize rock fractures with a high degree of accuracy (92%).
However, to enhance the quality and depth of analysis, it is imperative to address
several pivotal issues that are intrinsic to the [industry]. These issues possess the
potential for extensive application in associated domains, such as [domain], construction
and [domain]. During the course of my research, I have identified two primary problems that
require attention.
The first problem is the creation of 3D digital twins of rocks based on 2D rock
images. The solution of this problem allows to reveal spatial properties of rocks more
precisely, for example, by means of 3D - model unwrapping into 2D - plane for detailed
surface analysis. However, to enhance the rigor and scope of the analysis, it is imperative to
address several pivotal issues that are intrinsic to the [industry]. These issues
possess the potential for extensive application in associated domains, such as [domain]
and [domain]. These 3D twins play a critical role in the fluid dynamics modeling of
reservoirs. This modeling has a direct impaact on the efficiency of field development and
production forecasting. The methodology used to generate 3D models are based on the
synthesis of classical computer vision techniques (stereo vision, structure-from-motion,
multi-view stereo) and modern machine learning models (deep neural networks, GAN,
diffusion models), which ensures high accuracy and versatility of the solution.
The second problem is the automatic generation of natural language descriptions of
rock properties by 2D rock image. This greatly facilitates interaction between geologists,
reservoir modelers, civil engineers and other specialists, allowing quick and unambiguous
interpretation of complex analysis data. The implementaion of automated textual description
has been demonstrated to facilitate enhanced decision-making processes and more
effective integration of analysis results into established workflows.
Consequently, the resolution of these problems will not only enhance the quality and
speed of analysis in the [industry]. Furthermore, it will establish a foundation for
the adaptation and scaling of the developed algorithmns in related domains, including buildiing
and road design, medical diagnostics, and the reconstruction of three-dimensional models
from tomographic images. The study's findings underscore the significance of scalability and
interdisciplinary integration of cutting-edg machine learning and computer vision
methodologies, underscoring the study's relevance and demand.
Presently, I possess knowledge and ideas from the [industry] side; however, I also
recognize that I lack competencies in machine learning to actualize my ideas. I believe that
participation in the SMILES summer schoo
will have a significant impaact on the
development of current research endeavors and the expansion of knowledge in the field of
machine learning. Regardless of the outcome, the experience will undoubtedly contribute to
professional growth and development.
