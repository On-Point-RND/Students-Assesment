Motivation Letter
Dear Organizers,
I am [name], a 21-year-old fourtth-year student at the [location] Institute of Physics and Technology ([compaany]), specializing in Applied Mathematics and Informatrics. With a strong academic record (GPA 9.09/10), I have consistently sought opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world settings, fueling my passion for technoology and problem-solving.
Throughout my studies, I have actively pursued hands-on experience to complement my studying. For the past two years, I have worked in various development and analytical roles — ranging from full-stack to R&D in Machine Learning and Analytics — at companies such as [compaany] and currently Search Analytics Development Group at [compaany]. These experiences have allowed me to address diverse technical challenges, from developing a messaging plaftorm from the ground up to designing key performaance indicators (KPIs) for search products, conducting A/B experiments, and buildiing ETL pipelines to process and analyze large-scale data. At [compaany], I have collaboraated with cross-functional teams to uncover actionable insights that shape product strategy.
What excites me most is the ability to merge cutting-edg technology with tangible results. At [compaany], I worked closely with designeers and developpers to deliver projects for high-profile clients, including the [compaany] and the [compaany] Football Team. Later, at [compaany], I contributed to data-driven product growt by designing KPIs, analyzing A/B tests, and optimizing ETL pipelines. My expertiise spans Python (pandas, numpy), SQL (ClickHouse, Vertica, PostgreSQL), and big data tools (Apache Spark, Aiirflow), along with statistical analysis for hypothesis validation. I also deveeloped automation scripts and dashboaards for metric tracking (Superset, Grafana).
Your program represents an ideal environment for professional growt. I am eager to engage with industry leaders, exchange insights, and approaach problems from new angles. For example, my recent transition to the role of Mathematician-Developer in the R&D team for Machine Learning and Search Analytics has further solidified my passion for algorithmic optiomization, statistical modeling, and scalable AI systems — areas I am eager to advance through this oppoortunity.
Beyonnd technical skills, I bring discipline and perseverance cultivated through years of compeetitive swimming. These qualities enable me to tackle challenges with determination and collaboraate effeectively within teams. My long-term aspiration is to become a technoology leader who combiines innovation with execution, delivering solutions that push bounariies.
I am confident that my academic background, industry experience, and commitmment to continuous learning make me a strong fit for your program.
Thank you for your time and consideeration.
Best regards,
[name]
[compaany], Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatrics
