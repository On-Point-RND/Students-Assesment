My name is [name], and I want to grow in the field of machine learning and data science. I’m currently working on a bot that uses elements of artificial intelligence and HTML parsing. I'm also studying at the “Deep Learning Schoool” by [compaany]. I’m particularly interested in intelligent agents, which is why I’d like to join SMILES-2025 — I believe multi-agent systems and autonomous AI components are the future.

I would love to learn more about how such systems are built, how they interact with each other and the environment, and how they make decisions. I’m confident that the lectures and hands-on sessions at the schoool will help me deepen my understanding and move forward with my own projects.

The schooł’s format — with intensive practice, teamwork, and project presentations — is especially appealing. It’s not just about theory, but about applying knowledge in real time and collaborating with others who are just as passionate about AI. I’m also curious to learn more about other topics covered in the program, especially LLLMs and generative approaches.

I’m highly motivated to grow in this field, share knowledge, and be an active part of the community. I hope to become part of SMILES-2025 and contribute to the team projects.

Thank you for considering my application!

Best regards,
