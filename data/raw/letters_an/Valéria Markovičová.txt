Motivation – [name]
Experience with ML/DL
Over the past year, I’ve immersed myself in self-directed study of machine learning
and deep learning, seeing these tools as natural extensions of the econometrics framework
I’m currently exploring in my university studies. After completing my university’s data
analyst program last year, I’ve actively sought hands-on ML experience—experimenting
with diverse model architectures like random forests, gradient boosted trees (XGBoost),
neural networks with pretrained layers, convolutional neural networks, and hybrid
econometric-ML approaches. My participation in hackathons and research events has
allowed me to curate successful algorithms, which I now adapt for academic projects.
During this time I mostly created models for binary classification and regression in
economic context, but I also tried creating basic recommendation systems and computer
vision models. By now this exploration crystallized into two interconnected projects on
[location]'s energy sector:
1. As leader of a 5-person research team, I’m developing ML models to predict
regional electricity demand. We’ve built an interactive dashboard for exploratory analysis
and trained multiple models, but recently pivoted to blending econometric methods with
our ML pipeline to uncover causal relationships—inspired by the limitations of pure
correlation-based approaches.
2. As part of a larger interdisciplinary effort, I focus on geospatial data analysis—
using QGIS and Python to map infrastructure gaps and inefficiencies in the [location] Far
East. While other teams explore international trade implications or policy frameworks, my
work provides the spatial analytics layer that informs their recommendations.
Motivation for participation, expectations and plans:
SMILES2025 represents a critical next step: to formalize my self-taught knowledge
through academic collaboration, particularly in areas like causal ML and spatial
econometrics. I’m eager to contribute my hybrid perspective—where econometric theory
meets ML implementation—while learning to design more sophisticated systems.
Based on the program description, I expect SMILES2025 to emphasize NLP, with
other topics serving as extensions of this core focus. Out of those topics I have explored
reinforcement learning (RL) and generative AI through hands-on experimentation with
Keras and TensorFlow, but my current research in economics has shown RL to be most
applicable in game-theoretic contexts or multimodal AI systems—areas where traditional
modeling often suffices.
SMILES is particularly compelling as a collaboration between leading [location] and
[location] institutions. I am equally fluent in Russian, English and Mandarin Chinese, so
SMILES is a unique opportunity for me to visit [name] Institute of Technology (哈尔滨工
大), where I might continue my research in the field of computer science and AI in the
upcoming years.
