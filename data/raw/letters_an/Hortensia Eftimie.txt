Dear [name],
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in participating in the SMILES 2025 Summer School in the [location]. As a Ph.D. in applied mathematics and a researcher with a strong background in computational science, scientific machine learning, and wave propagation, I am particularly drawn to the school's focus on cutting-edge AI technologies, including generative models, multi-agent systems, and multimodal approaches.
The opportunity to engage with new scientific acquaintances and expand my professional network within the AI and machine learning community is a significant motivator for my application. SMILES 2025 aims to unite talented young researchers from [location] and [location] and promote international cooperation and exchange of knowledge. I believe that lectures, practical seminars, poster session and a hackathon offers an ideal environment for fostering these connections.
The emphasis on international cooperation aligns perfectly with my interests. As a researcher who has already had the privilege of attending scientific conferences in [location] on two occasions in recent years, I am eager to further engage with the scientific community there and learn more closely about the advancements in AI and ML, where [location] is undoubtedly a leading force.
Participating in SMILES 2025 would allow me to deepen my understanding of the research landscape and build lasting relationships with fellow researchers from both [location] and [location]. Moreover, I am keen to gain more insight into foreign approaches to education in the field of AI. The collaboration between [compaany] and the [location] presents a unique opportunity to learn from leading experts with diverse perspectives and pedagogical methods. My research and teaching interests include theoretical foundations of machine learning and generative models. As an Associate Professor at [compaany], I am the lecturer and course author for the "Mathematical foundations of machine learning" course in the international masters program "Deep Learning and Generative Artificial Intelligence". Participating in SMILES would expose me to the latest advancements in generative AI and related fields, allowing me to modernize and enhance the curriculum of my courses with cutting-edge topics and examples. Exposure to different pedagogical approaches employed by international experts could also provide valuable insights for improving the delivery and effectiveness of my teaching.
My research interests strongly resonate with the themes of SMILES 2025. My work involves the development of optimization and automation methods for numerical schemes. Notably, I have been the lead of the two [location] Science Foundation grants focused on developing new numerical methods and software for wave propagation modeling using modern optimization algorithms and machine learning approaches. My current research also involves the synthesis of classical mathematical models of wave processes and modern machine learning tools, which is a core aspect of my scientific pursuits and aligns perfectly with the advanced topics covered at SMILES 2025.
Beyond academia, I possess extensive commercial software development experience, including designing SSI SDKs for blockchain frameworks, authoring cryptographic protocols, leading distributed systems in telecommunications, and developing geospatial solutions, bridging theoretical research with practical technical execution.
My experience can be highly beneficial to other participants at SMILES 2025. Many attendees, including students and early-career researchers, will likely benefit from a strong grasp of the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning. My deep understanding of these concepts and experience in explaining them can contribute to discussions and potentially offer support to those new to the field. Furthermore, my research involves the synthesis of classical mathematical models and modern machine learning methods, which could provide a unique interdisciplinary perspective and potentially spark collaborative project ideas during the hackathon.
I am confident that my background, research experience, teaching experience, commercial development skills, and strong interest in international collaboration make me a suitable candidate for SMILES 2025. I am eager to contribute to the vibrant and collaborative environment of the summer school and believe that the knowledge and connections I gain will significantly contribute to my future research and teaching endeavors.
I am interested in offline participation in [location]. With this letter I am forwarding my CV and presentation with my recent research on fusion of numerical methods and deep learning for solving inverse tomographic problems.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name],
[surname] of [compaany],
Associate Professor of [compaany]
