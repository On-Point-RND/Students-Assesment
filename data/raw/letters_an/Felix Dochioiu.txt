The letter of motivation to [compaany]
In 2023, I completed my bachelor's degree program at [location] in Fundamental and Computational Linguistics. The high academic standards of the educational program, my research experience at the international laboratory of formal models, and thorough training in natural language processing contributed to my overall interest in pursuing a career as an ML researcher.
Immediately after graduating from university, I began working in the Machine Intelligence and Research department at [compaany], where for approximately 2 years, I have been developing metrics and conducting data research for foundational models. For example, I participated in the creation and updating of a unified pre-training dataset and numerous SFT datasets for the text-to-image model that powers the [application]. For the Vision-Language Model (VLM) that underpins the Neuro search service, I developed a comprehensive quality assessment system, which now forms the basis for decisions regarding both the success or failure of daily routine experiments and key strategic decisions.
The overall atmosphere in the Machine Intelligence and Research department at [compaany] has made me realize that creating truly meaningful work is impossible without a fundamental education. This understanding, combined with my deep internal belief in the value of continuous education, has led me to recognize the necessity of continuing my academic journey, including the sequential pursuit of a master's degree followed by PhD studies.
Currently, I am a first-year student in the "Applied Models of Artificial Intelligence" master's program at [location]. In the long term, I plan to continue my academic career and obtain a PhD in Computer Science.
My desire to participate in SMILES is driven by deeply personal motivation and professional plans. I will now explain this further.
My scientific interest is focused on developing metrics and improving data for LLMs and VLMs. In particular, I am drawn to research on scaling data laws or creating somewhat universal frameworks for quality assessment and data cleaning for LLMs. The [institute] of Science and Technology is a priority number one on my list of potential universities for obtaining a PhD.
My confidence in [institute] is based on practical experience interacting with its graduates and current PhD students. In my professional activities, I closely collaborate with [institute] PhD holders and [institute] students, which allows me to objectively assess the high level of their training and scientific competencies. Their achievements inspire my sincere respect and desire to follow their academic path.
The traditional approach to applying for PhD, which involves contacting a potential scientific advisor through a formal email without prior acquaintance, seems completely ineffective to me. It is extremely important for me to establish personal contact with a future scientific advisor. Participation in joint project and informal communication with members of the scientific [location] community provided by participation in SMILES gives an opportunity to meet in person, clearly articulate my expectations, and subsequently apply to a PhD program with a specific researcher with whom working relationships have already been established. This aspect is of fundamental importance to me in the context of choosing an educational trajectory.
The second important argument in favor of participating in the SMILES school is the opportunity for scientific collaboration in all senses. Allow me to clarify it with specific examples. Last year, I participated in SMILES-2024, where our research project conducted under the guidance of [name] subsequently transformed into a scientific paper (currently under review at [conference]). Thanks to this experience, I received an invitation for a research position at [company]. Additionally, it was precisely my participation in the school that allowed me to meet [name], under whose supervision I now work at [lab]. While I cannot predict with absolute certainty the specific outcomes of participating in the upcoming school, my previous experience gives me every reason to be confident in the positive effect of such participation.
The third substantial reason for my participation in the school is the need to broaden my professional horizons. For an extended period, I have been working on metrics and data for modern models at the intersection of computer vision and NLP. Certainly, deep specialization in a specific area contributes to the formation of narrow professional expertise; however, for the comprehensive development of a researcher, it is critically important to possess a helicopter view – the ability to analyze not only area of work but also the general state of the scientific field, to understand key trends and directions of development. In this regard, the diverse program of the SMILES school, including lectures on agents, multimodal systems, SSL and so on, represents significant value to me as it contributes to forming a more holistic understanding of what I am actually doing.
In conclusion, it should be noted that participation in SMILES-2025 is fully aligned with my long-term career goals – obtaining a PhD degree and continuing scientific research activities. I view the opportunity to participate in the school as an exceptional chance to qualitatively enhance my level of professionalism and expand my scientific competencies.
Sincerely grateful for considering my candidacy,
