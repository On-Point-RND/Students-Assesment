Dear [name],
I am excited to apply for the SMILES-2025 Summer School.
My job in [compaany] is concerned with the compaany-wide AI transformation, where we aim to use
agents and generative models to automate every possible business process. It is vital to show
that such an implementaion is profiitable, net of infrastructuraal expenses and is more profiitable
than the next best approaach of using smaller transformers and conventional models.
I’m currentlly working on two projects — one aims to increase the speed at which new software
updates are tested, and the other deals with improving the effectiiveness of client managers (who
generate most of the sales of investmment products).
Both projects require LLLMs to review large volumes of text and output relevant information in a
structured manner. Current attempts to use BERT models are underppeforming our expectaations.
I’m looking for the best cutting-edgе methods and approaches in solving these tasks, reducing
compute costs, and sharing these practical applications with the DS community, in our bank first
and potentially beyond.
In my previous projects I was primarily concerned with the quality of output — for example, I
trained a model for intent recognition to pull groups of relevant chunks for a RAG module, that
outperforms our previous matching through vector similarity. It’s currently deployed in the Virtual
Assistant in the [compaany] Online mobile app.
Currrently the biggest challenge is compute costs and time. The output of both of my projects will
be used by employees of the bank so having perfect accuracy is unnecessary. However, feeding
a model every single transcript of every conversation between a client manager and a client eats
up available computing power rapidlly and I will need to prove that these compute costs are worth
a marginal increase in client manager performance.
In my team I’m responsible for the full cycle of Data Science support, this begiins with discussions
with the product owners on how their processes will be affected and ends, after deploying the
models in proving their financial effect. The financial effect is proved as a marginal increase over
the next best method.
I have a master’s degree in applied mathematics and physics from [university] and during my studies what attracted me to the field of ML in the first place, was when
I first heard about how word2vec was first trained and how it resulted in the case of
𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔−𝑚𝑎𝑛+𝑤𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑛 = 𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑒𝑛. I immediatly worked to figure out how it was that we can now
do equations with words! It seems like such a small thing now, but when you first discover something like this you realize that whatever the future is, it's in this field that it's being made. So,
I started taking classes and courses and learning programming so I could get a job in the field
immediatly on graduaation.
On the weekends when I’m free from work, I often assist at the Laboratory of metal-complex and
nanoscale catalysts of [institute] in applying machine learning
to problems in the field of chemistry. Mostly in spectroscopy analysis automation in which I’ve co-
authored four publications. Recentlly our institute has gotten grant to speed up research by AI,
including training LLLMs to act as researchers in a multi-agent framework and I’m sure the summer
course will prove invaluable here as well.
I know the community around [organization] is very motivated and the networking opportunities on this
course sound fantastic — working in teams and everyone presenting and explaining their projects
will mean everyone will have the opportunity to talk in-depth about whatever interests them after
classes and after retuurning from [country].
The program being in English is a big plus for me, English is the language of science and all of the
important research is published in English, all of the forums discussing any niche approaach
are in English and I’ve put in a lot of effort to become as fluent as possible. An opportunity to
spend two weeks in an environment where everyone is working in English would greatly improve
my speaking and listening.
I hope that everything that I’m learning now, and everything that I learn during the summer course
will let me succeed fantastically in my projects as I’m only in the startiing steps of my career and
success here will let me take on more responsibility and projects that have a larger impaact.
