Dear [name] [surname] Organizing Committee,
Participating in SMILES-2024 gave me a unique experience: I realized how collaboractive,
experimental environments with clear structure and high-level mentorship can accelerate
both learning and meaningful research. Returning to SMILES in 2025, I aim to go further —
to grow not just as a user of machine learning tools, but as somoone who can design
thoughtful, interpretable, and responsible ML systems from end to end.
Over the past year, I’ve been working on automating candidate-vacancy matching using
transformer-based embeddings and vector search systems. One of the key insights I gained
was not just about the quality of models, but about their usability in real decision-making
systems. How does explainability affect trust? What does fairness mean when a model ranks
people? These questions pushed me to rethiink how ML tools should be evaluaated — beyond
metrics like ROC-AUC — and sparked my interest in human-centered evaluation, a topic I
hope to explore deeper at SMILES-2025.
I’ve worked with a range of ML and DL tools — not only in terms of frameworks like PyTorch,
TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn, but also in the context of designing experiments, debugging
convergence issues, and interpreting model behavior. For example, while fine-tuning
multilingual transformer models for semantic search in recruitment systems, I encountered
challenges related to domain shift and annotation bias, which led me to explore techniques
like contrastive learning and embedding regularization. I’ve also built time-series models
using LSTM and Prophet, experimenteed with GANs for synthetic data generation, and
applied XGBoost and CatBoost in tabular pipelines.
My long-term plan is to pursue a Ph.D. or join a research team focused on applied,
socially-aware AI systems — tools that don’t just “work,” but help people in education, hiring,
or mental health. I’m currently exploring projects at the intersection of NLP, recommender
systems, and generative models, and I want to deepen my knowlege of those areas both
theoretically and practically. SMILES-2025 offers a rare chance to connect with peers who
share this ambition, and to test ideas in a setting that values clarity, reproducibility, and
impaact.
Thank you for considering my application. I see SMILES-2025 not just as a schoo, but as a
collaboraative research playground — and I’m excited to contribute, build, and learn.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
