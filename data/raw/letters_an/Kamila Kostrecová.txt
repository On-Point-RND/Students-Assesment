laboratory at the [company]. However, I would be delighted
to engage in your project. I believe that even without extensive experience, a person can
contribute meaningfully to a field they are genuinely passionate about.
I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to communicate with students and professionals
from [location], as I believe that Chinese robotics technologies are very advanced. I am confident
that my goals align closely with those of the SMILES-2025 program, and I am eager to

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to participate in
SMILES-2025.
