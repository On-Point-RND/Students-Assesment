Motivation letter
[name]
My path in machine learning and deep learning began in high schooL during the 11th class.
Since then, I’ve graduaed from [location], worked at big tech [compaany] as ML engineer and
won several ML/DL competitions. Now I’m totally focused on research at [compaany] (MSc,
Data Science) and also study at [compaany].
My personal motivation in ML/DL is to make systems, that surpass humans capabilities,
solve tasks that are beyond humans reach and make our lives better. Due to this, my dreaM
and long-term goal is to create AGI/ASI – that’s my main purpose in AI domain. Today we
live in the era of agents, and I’m convinced that it’s the best time ever to let my dreaM
happen. I believe, that with every step that develop better agent’s abilities, we make our lives
better.
In my career, I’ve worked with different ML/DL domains. I started with tabular data
processing where I was building ensembles of standard ML algorithm s with advanced
Tabular Deep learning models. Also I’ve worked in NLP with LLMs at big tech, university and
hackatho ns. For now, my research interest is in Generative models, Multimodal models and
Reinforcement Learning. Mainlly, my interest in GeNAI was sparked by a course on
(Neuro)Bayesian methods of ML by [name] that I have passed at [compaany] department at
[location]. Now I research Physical laws in Video Generation for better wo rld understanding of
DL models.
My future plans are to pass PhD, work with big research team and make several A* papers
to make a significant contribution in Agent’s development.
From the SMILES summer schooL, I expect the oppo rtunity to work on a real research
proje ct that could result in an article. I’m convinced that collabora tion leads to innovative
ideas and projects. That’s why it is important for me to be in be at the SMILES this summer –
I need to create something new and innovative.
