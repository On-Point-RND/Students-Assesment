Hi! My name is [name]. I want to participatate in summer schooal of machine learning.
First of all even participating in your entering competition is important for me – I learned many
things while solving the test's tasks. Another reason is I want to solve interesting tasks in my future.
What I like and appreciate is that you mostly judge the participants by their test's results and
presentation. So I have a chance! It's just I don't have relevant background but learn quickly. And it
appears to be a good time for me to learn!
During the last year I have been learning machine learning. I participated in a challenge on [compaany] –
it was the 2023 competition, but I liked it and wanted to find a better solution:

I don't have high expectaions yet. It is one of my first steps, I only had a couple before. So my
future goal I can speak of right now is to get smairte and earn some money☺
