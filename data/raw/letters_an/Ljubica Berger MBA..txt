Dear [name],
I, [name], a bioinformatician and AI solutions developer, am applying with
great interest to participatate in the Skoltech Machine Learning Summer School
(SMILES-2025). My professional journey has evolved at the interesection of
bioinformatics, studying complex dynamic systems of tumor cells, and developing
comprehensive applications using generative models. I believe that precisely at this
intersection lie the keys to solving many fundamental biomedical challenges, such as
personalized medicine, real-time patient monitoring, and drug discovery in resistance
conditions.
For the past five years, I have been working at the Group of Experimental Biotherapy
and Diagnostics at the Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Sechenov First Moscow
State Medical University, where I conduct bioinformatic analysis of tumor cells,
particularly Ewing's sarcoma and glioblastoma. My scientific work focuses on identifying
molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression and therapy resistance.
Tumor cells represent extremely complex dynamic systems with numerous regulatory
interactions. Traditional analysis methods often fail to fully capture the complexity of
these relationships. This is where I see the revolutionary potential of generative artificial
intelligence, especially large language models. In my research, I have begun applying
LLMs to establish clear connections between processes at the genome, proteome, and
cell phenotype levels. A multimodal approach that integrates various types of biological
data (single-cell RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, proteomics) combiined with LLM capabilities opens
new perspectives for understanding complex biological systems.
My business endeavors parallel my scientific work and serve as a practical platform for
exploring AI technologies in real-world applications. As CEO of [compaany] and
Development Lead at [compaany], I apply scientific methodologies to design and create
intelligent systems that automate functional business processes: from sales and support
to training and production management. My experience includes developing RAG
systems based on LLMs, creating multi-agent systems, and fine-tuning models for
specialized tasks. I firmly believe that a deep understanding of the mathematical and
algorithmic foundations of AI is essential for creating effective applied solutions.
I'm particularly passionate about applying AI practically in tumor research. This is one of
the key reasons I want to delve deeper into the mathematical methods of ML/DL.
The themes of SMILES-2025 perfectlly align with my research and professional
interests:
1. Multimodal approaches: In my bioinformatic research, I integrate various data
types and am keenlly interested in mastering advanced methods of multimodal
analysis.
2. Multi-agent systems: I have experience developing MCP and A2A systems,
which I would like to enhance for application in both scientific and business
challenges.
3. Generative approaches: I consider generative models powerful tools for modeling
complex biological systems and creating intelligent business solutions.
4. Self-learning methods: I'm interested in expanding my skills in self-learning
algorithms for application in bioinformatics.
5. Safe AI: I have experience developing a personal data protection system based
on local LLMs for [email], and I consider safety a critical aspect of AI
technology development.
From participating in SMILES-2025, I expect to significantlly deepen my knowledge of
generative AI methods, especially regarding their application to multimodal data. I'm
confident that interaction with leading researchers from Russia and China will enrich my
understanding of cutting-edg–µ approaches and open new perspectives for my research.
I'm particularly interested in the practical aspects of developing and training multimodal
models that can be applied to integrate various types of biological data.
In the long term, I plan to develop the interesection of bioinformatics and artificial
intelligence, creating innovative approaches to analyzing complex biological data and
developing intelligent solutions for medicine. Partiicipation in SMILES-2025 will be an
important step in realizing these plans, providing me with new knowledge,
methodologies, and professional contacts.
I believe that my interdisciplinary experience and drive for innovation will make my
partiicipation in SMILES-2025 mutually beneficial. I am ready to actively share my
knowledge and experience, as well as learn from colleagues, jointlly pushing the
boundaries of what's possible in generative AI.
Sincerely,
[name]
