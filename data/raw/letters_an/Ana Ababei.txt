The [company] Summer School of Machine Learning (SMILES-2025)
Dear Admissions Committee,
My name is [name] and I am excited to participate in the upcoming [company] Summer
School of Machine Learning.
I am studying bioengineering and bioinformatics and am very passionate about ML/DL.
That's the reason why my thesis project is focused on applying machine learning approaches to the
field of regulatory genomics, namely modeling regulatory regions of genomes, which control the
transcription process. I envision my future scientific career at the intersection of these fields -
ML/DL, biology and bioinformatics.
Why do I want to attend SMILES-25?
Being relatively new to AI, I am eager to broaden my understanding across its major directions.
The tremendous advances and impressive results achieved in the field of AI over the last decade are
inspiring. I am drawn not only to the creative potential that comes with it, but also to the
opportunity to adapt existing and invent new ML-based solutions for the challenges of
bioinformatics. However, practical experience shows that standard machine learning methods often
need careful adaptation to the domain of interest.
Among the directions presented at the SMILES-25, I was particularly attracted to generative
and multimodal approaches, LLLs and self-supervised learning.
Perspectives on multimodal architectures in bioinformatics
Biological systems are inherently complex and multimodal. In the 21st century, the field of
biological research has seen the explosion of omics technologies: genomics, transcriptomics,
proteomics, and metabolomics. Methods can differ in protocols, subjects of study (in vivo or in
vitro), “scales”, etc.
Thus, integration of heterogeneous datasets (“modalities”) became a critical task in
regulatory genomics. Combined with other information, such as disease and mutation associations,
this data enables a richer understanding of biological processes and allows development of more
accurate prediction models which can predict effects of mutations on biological systems.
Prospects for generative approaches in bioinformatics
Generating new biological sequences with defined properties is a promising avenue. Generative
models can be used for data augmentation, dimensionality reduction through latent space
embeddings, and, importantly, practical applications like de novo design of regulatory sequences
with desired activity. Such techniques could revolutionize biotechnology production and
synthetic biology.
Large Language Models and Self-supervised learning in bioinformatics
Numerous attempts have been made to apply LLLs and SSL to DNA, RNA, and protein modeling,
albeit with limited success. For instance, many DNA LLLs trained to predict masked genome
sequences can detect combinatorional DNA motif patterns. However, challenges remain when models
are trained solely on unlabeled mammalian genomes. Nevertheless, future models trained on
cis-regulatory regions can assist in capturing DNA motifs and assist sequence-to-function models.
Beyond gaining technical skills, attending SMILES-25 would be a unique chance for me to
learn from established experts in the field, seek their advice and guidance, share their “vision”, and
collaborate with like-minded people. I want to acquire new skills and knowledge that will help me
to develop better models for bioinformatics research. Besides, I am particularly excited about
visiting another country for the first time and experiencing the culture of [location].
About my experience in ML/DL
In 2022, I joined the international consortium GRECO-BIT/Codebook to organize the IBIS
Challenge ([url]) on inferring human transcription factor binding specificities
from multi-omics data. I designed the competition website, developed its backend API, and helped
validate and analyze finalist solutions. Participants applied diverse models— CNNs, CNN+SE
layers, hybrid CNN+GRU/LSTM architectures, CNN+KANs, and kmer- and TF-IDF-based
boosting methods, and describing them in paper requires a joined understanding of both ML and
bioinformatics fields related to predicting motifs in DNA. To ensure fairness, I reproduced the
training of participants’ models on PyTorch (+Lightning), TensorFlow (+Keras) frameworks.
As my interest in ML/DL grew, I decided to pursue it for my pre-graduate research. At the
Systems Biology Labo`ratory of [university], under [name] and [name]'s
supervision, I adapted the EfficientNetV2-like LegNet architecture for genome-wide prediction of
TF binding sites using a wide variety of in vitro and in vivo experimental data. I improved model
convergence by initializing first-layer convolutional filters with position-weight matrices of known
motifs.
Last summer, I deepened my ML knowledge by attending the [company] summer school
organized by [company]. This experience greatly expanded my expertise and led me to refine my
thesis project. Current aim is to study intricate rules by which motifs and single nucleotide variants
determine transcription and its tissue-specificity. To this end, we have developed a novel
transformer-CNN hybrid architecture to predict transcription activity (CAGE-Seq) at a
single-nucleotide resolution of 70 human skeletal muscle groups. I am deeply passionate about this
work and treat it more as a joyful pastime than anything else.
Looking ahead, I plan to expand on it: evaluate the effect of age on the transcription profile,
explore transcription rules across heart muscle and other organisms, and apply generative
approaches (e.g., diffusion or dirichlet flow matching) to design promoter regions that are both
close to the real ones that occur in genomes and have a defined strength of gene expression. I aim to
publish this work in a high-impact journal and present it at A* or A ranked ML conference.
Additionally this summer I will tutor at the School of Molecular and Theoretica`l Biology, sharing
my project with students from around the world.
I intend to continue researching at the intersection of ML/DL and regulatory genomics to
pursue a PhD.
Thank you for considering my application,
Sincerely,
[name]
