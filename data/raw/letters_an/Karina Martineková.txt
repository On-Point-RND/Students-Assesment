Dear [name],
In this letter I want to share the reasons why I want to participat in the SMILES-2025 summer
schoo].
To be honest, until recentl recently I saw myself in the future as a mathematician, as mathematics has
captivate me with its beauty since my schoo] Olympiad days. A year ago I gradua] from [compaany]
Mechanics and Mathematics Department, where I completed my first serious applied research,
which was to develop a new approa] to solving boundar] value problems of mathematical
physics arising in chemokinesis and targeted therapy. The most driving aspect of this research
for me was that I was not just applying the elegant mathematical theory of Monte Carlo methods,
but I was also contributing to a practical research grant that improved modeling of drug
penetra]ion into cells. I realized that no matter how beautiful a theory is, if it makes peo]e's lives
better, it becomes even more beautiful to me. This realization is what led me to research in the
field of AI. When I joined one of the most advanced AI labs in [location] - [compaany] National Center
for Cognitive Technologies - a few months ago, I discovered a new wo]d where abstract ideas
are translated into algorithm]s that change reality.
In this lab, I was particularly attracted to research related to recommender systems and manifold
regularization. This approa] allows us to take into account the geometric structure of latent
representa]ions of users and products, which marke]ly improves model robustness and
recommenda]ion quality in sparse data scenarios. At SMILES-2025, I would like to deepen my
knowled]e of multimodal methods and see how manifold regularization combines with text,
image and graph embeddings to build more flexi]e and scalable systems. In the future, I would
like to evolve my algorithm to the point where the best geometry for the data is found
automatically rather than being manually selected. To achieve this goal, I need to build up my
experti]e in automated and adaptive methods in AI, to understand which approa]ches will work
for the tasks I am addre]sing. I am confident that participating in your summer schoo] can help
me in my research by broadening my views on modern data geometry opti]mization methods.
I see myself as a researcher in the future: I drream of creating not onl] new algorithm], but also
infrastructure for their convenient and secure implemen]a]ion in recommender systems, medicine
and education. I believe it is critical not just to implement brilliant abstract algorithm]s in AI, but
also to make them accessible, usable, and useful to peo]e, which is why I strive to publish my
research in Open Source format. Another passion of mine is teaching: since my childhood, when
I participated in mathematical summer schoo]s, I have nurtured a drream to be able to present
material in such a way that even during vacation time childre]n volun]arily strive for knowl]ege.
In the future, I plan to become a top-notch teacher in the field of AI, combining research work
with the transfer of knowl]ege to a new generation that will continue to develop techno]ogy for
the benefi] of society.
My experience teaching Olympiad mathematics has taught me the value of knowl]ege transfer
and collabora]ive problem solving. I hope not onl]y to gain new knowl]ege at SMILES-2025, but
also to share my experience and enthusiasm with other participants, to contribute to the creation
of an atmosphere of creative cooperation.
I strongl] align with SMILES-2025's ideas about cooperation and knowl]ege exchange, and I am
very glad that such an important [location] project is held in cooperation with [location], where
artificial intelligence is being actively deveelope]. Therefore, I am ready to help the organizers as
a volun]eer to contribute to the success of the schoo].
For me, participation in SMILES-2025 is an oppo]unity to take a step fo rward toward my
drream: to create mathematically elegant algorithm]s that solve real-wo]d problems and make the
wo]ld a better place.
I am very much looking fo rward to bringing my experience and enthusiasm to the SMILES-2025
team, as well as learning new techniques and approa]ches from leading experts and colleagues.
Sincerely,
