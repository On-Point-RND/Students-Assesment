Motivation Letter for SMILES Summer School of Machine Learning
Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my enthusiastic application to the SMILES Summer School of Machine Learning. As an early-career researcher specializing in physics-informed machine learning and scientific computing, I see this program as a unique opportunity to advance my research while contributing meaningfully to the school's intellectual community. My work sits at the exciting intersection of applied mathematics, machine learning, and computational physics, with particular focus on developing novel algorithms for solving and discovering differential equations.
My research journey has equipped me with a robust technical foundation in modern machine learning tools and methodologies. I have developed substantial expertise working with: python and main libraries for ML as PyTorch for implementing and training custom neural network architectures; JAX for building high-performance, differentiable scientific computing applications and training operators; the EPDE (Evolutionary Partial Differential Equations) framework for evolutionary equation discovery, combining genetic algorithms with neural network methods; SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics) for data-driven system identification and other implementations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with modified loss functions.
My research focuses on physics-informed machine learning and equation discovery methods, with particular emphasis on solving partial differential equations using neural networks and identifying governing equations from physical data. I am currently investigating two main approaches: first, optimizing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) through architectural modifications and specialized loss functions to accurately reproduce solutions; second, developing machine learning frameworks that combine symbolic regression with optimization techniques to extract interpretable equations from observational data. A crucial aspect of my recent work involves analyzing how different numerical differentiation methods affect the uncertainty of discovered equations, as both raw data and their derivatives serve as essential features in this process.
Recently, I have been exploring the application of generative models, particularly diffusion networks, for physical field generation. I am especially interested in how stochastic differential equations underlying Schrödinger bridge constructions can be optimized to accelerate image generation processes. My current project focuses on identifying modified equations that could enhance the integration of Schrödinger bridges into diffusion networks, potentially leading to significant computational speedups. This work has revealed fascinating connections between optimal transport theory, stochastic processes, and practical machine learning implementations. However, several open challenges remain where I believe the SMILES Summer School could provide crucial insights. The summer school's focus on generative machine learning presents an exceptional opportunity to advance this research, particularly through interactions with leading experts from the strong Chinese and Russian schools of thought in this domain. Specifically, I hope to discuss my current work on Schrödinger bridges with experts in generative modeling, explore potential applications of my equation discovery methods to new domains and also establish collaborations that could lead to joint publications.
As I progress toward completing my dissertation and establishing myself as an independent researcher, participation in prestigious programs like SMILES becomes increasingly important. My near-term goals include dissertation completion: I aim to incorporate insights from the summer school into my PhD, particularly in developing more robust and efficient algorithms for physics-informed machine learning. I would like to publish my research on neural differential equations and generative modeling in top-tier venues, building on knowledge and connection made during the program.
The SMILES Summer School represents a strategic opportunity to advance all these objectives simultaneously. The program's unique combination of theoretical depth, practical focus, and access to leading experts makes it ideally suited to help me transition from doctoral research to independent investigation. I am confident that my technical background in physics-informed machine learning, combined with my active research in equation discovery and generative modeling, would allow me to contribute meaningfully to the SMILES community. At the same time, I believe the school's resources and intellectual environment would provide transformative input for my ongoing and future work.
The opportunity to network with leading Chinese and Russian artificial intelligence researchers and contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the field of scientific machine learning would be invaluable both for my immediate research goals and for my long-term professional development. I would be honored to participate in this program and look forward to the possibility of joining this vibrant intellectual community.
Sincerely,
