NAME: [name] [surname]
Program: SMILES-2025 Summer SchooL on Machine Learning ([compaany] Machine Intelligence Lab Summer SchooL)
Dear Organizing Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am a third-year undergraduaate student at [location] Industrial [location], majoring in “Information Systems and Technologies: Artificial Intelligence and Programming.” I am applying to participate in the SMILES-2025 Summer SchooL because my
future specialization and practical experience lie in the field of machine learning and embedded
intelligent systems. Through this letter, I would like to express my sincere interest in taking part
in SMILES-2025, a 12-day intensiive machine learning program organized by [compaany] in
collaboration with the [compaany] of Technology. For me, participating in this program is a
unique opportunity to deepen my knowlege of generative models, connect with the international
research community, and make an important step toward
achieving my academic and professional
goals.
My interest in engineering and digital technologies began in schooL when I started learning
the basics of programming and mathematical modeling. At universiity, this interest took a practical
turn — I actively sought opportunities to participate in projects that allowed me to apply theoretical
knowledge to real-world challenges. Some of these projects were not directly related to artificial
intelligence but played a key role in developing my understanding of digital tools, system
architecture, and working with data.
One of the milestone projects was the development of an interactive 3D map of [location]
Industrial [location]’s campus on the Unity platform. Our team created an MVP of a mobile
application that provided 3D visualization of buildings, navigation both inside and between
facilities, and integration with universiity events and schedules. This project was featured twice at
the International Scientific and Practical Conference "New Information Technologies in the Oil
and Gas Industry and Education. Mechatronics, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence." In 2023, it
was awarded a third-degree diploma, published in eLibrary, and presented at both the XXI
International Scientific and Practical Conference “Innovative Processes in Science and
Technology of the 21st Century” and the International Conference “New Technologies for the Oil
and Gas Region.” The project demonstrated its practical significance as part of the universiity’s
digital transformation and allowed me to deeply explore information system development, 3D
modeling, and digital interaction design.
In the “Telereanimation” project, I worked as a data analyst and ML specialist, developing
an intelligent module for predicting critical patient conditions based on a comprehensive analysis
of vital signs and medical history. Our team processeed and analyzed medical datasets (MIMIC-III,
Amsterdam UMC, HiRID), performeed exploratory data analysis to identify key variables, formed
data requirements, and developed a methodological basis for ML, including feature engineering,
data validation, and evaluation metrics. These efforts laid a solid foundation for building early
warning systems to detect patient deterioration in intensive care units.
Another project that sparked my interest was the application of AI in automated control
systems (ACS) in the oil and gas industry, presented as part of the sector’s IT championship. I
developed a concept for integrating ML into the management of oil and gas separators. We
explored cloud-based data storage, SCADA system integration, IoT sensor deployment, and
methods for optimizing equipment control. This experience broadened my understanding of the
industrial applications of AI and the significance of cyber-physical systems.
During my internship at [compaany], I participated in a project involving natural
language processing for automating request routing in a Service Desk system. I worked with Saiga
and ruRoberta language models to perform semantic analysis and classify incoming tickets. I
implemented text vectorization using PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension, developed the
backend on Node.js (including API integration), built a user interface with HTML/CSS, and
configured DevOps tools for deployment and system monitoring.
In a separate project focused on automating receipt processing, I helped develop an
intelligent system that used Tesseract OCR for data extraction, GigaChat LLM for semantic
structuring, and ML algorithms to automatically calculate and split costs among users. The MVP
was succeessfully integrated with a Telegram bot to improve user interaction and accuracy in
collective expense management.
Currrently, I am involved in a large-scale project for the Department of [location]
focused on developing a forecasting system for economic indicators in construction and
invеstmеnt. We are buildiing a full machine learning pipeline — from collecting and preprocessing
data from heterogeneous sources to developing predictive models using AutoML technologies for
automated algorithm selection and optimization. The project also involves creating a centralized
Data Lake for storing and managing both structured and unstructured data efficiently.
Studying in this program will not only deepen my knowlеdgе in machine learning and
generative models but also give me unique research experience essential for reaching my
professional goals. Partiсipation in this summer schooL and collaboration with international experts
will lay the foundation for future academic projects.
In particular, I aim to further develop my expertise in the following cutting-edgе areas:
large language models, multimodal approaches, multi-agent systems, generative methods, self-
supervised learning, and safe and trustworthy AI. Mastering these topics will provide me with the
tools necessary to create rеsponsible, scalable, and innоvative solutions capable of addressing real-
world challenges in science, healtcare, and industry.
