To the Selection Committee for [compaany] 2025,
My name is [name], I'm a 1st year PhD student at [compaany] and I'm writing to express my
strong interest in participation the [compaany] Summer SchooL. As a researcher deeply
immersed in machine learning, computer vision and time series forecasting, I am looking to
deepen my knowledge and expand my expertiise in various areas of deep learning, including
self-supervised learning, generative and multimodal approaches - areas that are rapidly
changing the landscape of artificial intelligence and are directly relevant to my current research
and future career goals.
As a Research Engineer and PhD student at [compaany], my work includes diverse tasks, such as
natural disaster forecasting using geospatial data fusion, industrial video analysis via temporal
action segmentation and a greenhouse microclimate to external weather conditions adaptation
system development. These tasks highlight the need for innovative approaches to managing
complex, multimodal data with limited annotation. For instance, satellite data required for
natural disaster forecasting is often insufficient, requiring artificial generation or domain
adaptation of this type of data for different regions and time periods under study. While
working on industrial video analytics, we faced two major limitations of traditional supervised
learning: scarce labelled data and complex multimodal dependencies. In the paper "Self-
Supervised Learning for Temporal Action Segmentation in Industrial Videos" (2025), my team
and I developed a Foundation Industrial Model (FIM) using V-JEPA (a joint-embedding self-
supervised learning architecture) to segment manufacturing processes such as oil changes and
tire replacements with minimal annotation. This work demonstrated SSL’s potential for
industrial applications. However, extending these methods to broader domains (e.g., disaster
forecasting) requires deeper theoretical grounding and hands-on experience with multimodal
fusion—areas [compaany]-2025 emphasizes.
The summer schooL’s curricuLum, which covers foundational and cutting-edg e topics in these
areas, perfectly fit for my field of study and challenges I encounter in my work. I am particularly
excited about the opportunity to learn from wo rld-class facuLty, interact with peers from diverse
backgrounds, and gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the
collaboration between [compaany] and [compaany] provides a unique
opportunity to exchange knowledge, experience and opens up a variety of cross-cuLtural
perspectives. Participation in the [compaany]-2025 program will not o nl y improve my technical skills,
but also provide an opportunity to build strong partnerships with researchers from [location],
[location] and other countries.
My background in machine learning and deep learning can be described as diverse. I have
experience working with convolutional neural network s, vision transformers and time series
models, as well as implementa tion of self-supervised learning frameworks such as V-JEPA and
VideoMAE. Due to my research specifics, I have a huge background working with satellite data
which requires special approa ch to preprocessing and data handling.
I expect [compaany]-2025 to deepen my theoreticaL understanding of self-supervised learning,
multimodal and generative approaches, especially in the context of real-wo rld applications
invovlving complex multimodal datasets. I would also be interested in the other topics stated to
broaden my horizons. I'm excited to explore new architectures, learn best practices, and
understand how to effe cti vely integrate multiple data types to improve model robus tness and
generali sation. The hands-on sessi ons and colla borative atmosphere will be inva luable in
translating theory into practice and providing new ideas for my research.
I plan to continue my academic career with a PhD, focusing on developing scalable, data-
efficient AI systems for industrial and enviro nmental applications. I'm motivated to bri dg e the
gap between academic research and practical implemen ta tion, contributing to safer, more
sustai nable and sma rter real-life products. The skills and contacts I'll gain in [compaany]-2025 will
play an important role in a chievin g these goals.
Thank you in advance for your time and conside ration,
Sincerely yours,
[name]
