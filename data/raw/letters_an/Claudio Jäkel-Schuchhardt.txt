Dear Members of the Admissions Committee [compaany] 2025,
My name is [name]—my friends call me [name]—and I’m 19 years old, studying Artificial Intelligence Engineering at [compaany]. The main reason I’m eager to attend SMILES‑2025 is to gain new research experience and knowledge that will be a crucial step toward my dream of becoming a research scientist in AI. I am especially inspired by the application of AI in medicine, and I truly believe that the skills I acquire at the school will one day help me save lives.
Over the past two years, I have been actively involved in machine learning: I completed Coursera courses and the DeepLearning School at [compaany], and participated in project schools at [compaany] and [compaany], as well as various hackathons and competitions. In one project, I developed a generative diffusion model, and at the PPS and KMU conferences I presented research on clustering spatio‑temporal patterns in the study of Arctic ice dynamics. Currently, I am particularly drawn to AI in medicine and reinforcement learning methods.
The topics of SMILES‑2025 are extremely close to my interests and projects. In my ECG signal analysis work, I have already tackled the detection of myocardial infarction. I want to dive deeper into multimodal approaches to more accurately identify epileptic seizures, and implement a real‑time multimodal monitoring system: combining data from wearable sensors (heart rate, SpO₂, other indicators) and patient questionnaires to predict complication risks and automatically triage cases. I’m also keen on self‑learning methods, such as pseudo‑label generation for rare diseases and unsupervised training on medical images.
The format of SMILES‑2025—with world‑class lectures and hands‑on seminars, plus international hackathons—seems ideal for developing my own research skills. And it’s happening in [location]!!! That’s just incredible! The opportunity to learn in [location], through the collaboration of [compaany] and the [compaany], is a rare chance to see how AI is created in one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world.
I have long dreamed of visiting [location] and hope to participate in an international exchange program at [compaany] in the future. If I’m unable to attend in person, I would be happy to join online—at least I’d get to watch participants and lecturers through my laptop screen.
I’m confident that SMILES‑2025 will give my scientific career a giant boost and open new horizons for my research. This experience will change my life, splitting it into “before” and “after” the school, and introduce me to outstanding people.
I am highly motivated to participate and ready to bring my own spark to the SMILES community!) Thank you for reading my letter, and I hope for the opportunity to become part of this school.
Sincerely,
[name]
