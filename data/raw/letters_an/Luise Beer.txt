Motivational Letter for SMILES
Dear SMILES-2025 Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my keen interest in participating in the Skoltech Summer Schoool of Machine
Learning(SMILES-2025). As a student deeply immersed in the field of artificial intelligence, I am excited
by the opportunity to engage with cutting-edge research in generative methods, collaborate with like-
minded peers from around the world, and contribute to a vibrant exchange of knowledge between [location] and [location].
My academic and research journey has revolved around machine learning and its advanced paradigms.
I have pursued in-depth studies in deep learning, natural language processing, and generative modeling, including experience with transformers, diffusion models, and self-supervised learning. Through course-
work and hands-on projects, I have developed a solid understanding of the theoretical principles and
practical applications of modern AI systems.
I am particularly drawn to the structure and mission of SMILES-2025. The program’s combination of
lectures, workshops, and hackathons provides a unique setting for gaining practical skills and exploring
innovative ideas. I am eager to challenge myself with real-world problems, learn from leading experts in
the field, and take part in collaborative projects that extend beyond academic boundaries.
What also excites me is the emphasis on international cooperation and cultural exchange. I strongly
believe that progress in AI is accelerated when diverse perspectives come together — and SMILES-2025
is a perfect platform for such synergy.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to join this year’s cohort and bring
my curiosity, dedication, and collaborative spirit to the SMILES-2025 experience.
Sincerely, [name] [surname]
