Dear Members of the Selection Committee,
My name is [name], and I am a fifth-year student in the Physics Department at [location] [compaany]. I would be honored to participate in the upcoming SMILES Summer School on Machine Learning.
I am a fifth-year student in the Faculty of Physics, conducting research in laser biophotonics. My work focuses on analyzing data from optical experiments. Typically, I search for meaningful spectral features that correlate with changes in the properties of biological specimens (cells, tissues, molecular compounds, etc.), which can inform the development of diagnostic methods in medicine. In my analyses, I draw on statistical techniques and, for the most part, classical machine-learning methods. For example, I led a large-scale study of the optical characteristics of roughly a thousand cells, analyzing the statistical variations in their light-response profiles. As part of this work, I also developed a classifier to identify patients with atherosclerosis based on the optical signatures of their immune cells. Currently, I am spearheading another major project: designing a rapid, spectrum-based method for bacterial identification.
I am currently developing a machine-learning pipeline to classify porphyrins based on their spectral signatures. The SMILES Summer School’s intensive format will introduce me to state-of-the-art methodologies and AI-safety practices—ensuring that I can both optimize model performance and trust its decision-making, which is vital when working with sensitive biomedical data.
My preparation spans several fronts. I have completed university courses in introductory machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis for optical experiments. In my biophotonics research, I applied classical algorithms to classify bacterial species and performed unsupervised clustering on unlabeled datasets. I presented these projects at the [location] Conference and at the International School of Biophotonics, receiving positive feedback from experts in the field.
Looking ahead, I am considering pursuing a PhD at [compaany]'s Center for Artificial Intelligence while also exploring a career in AI R&D. By attending SMILES, I hope to refine my thesis ideas, immerse myself in cutting-edge techniques, and deepen my understanding of the protocols that ensure safe and reliable AI for biomedical applications.
Equally important is the opportunity to forge connections. Collaborating on projects, obtaining constructive feedback, and discovering emerging tools will help me build a professional network to support both my academic goals and long-term ambitions in industry research.
Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that SMILES will accelerate my porphyrin classification work, strengthen my mastery of AI safety, and guide me toward success in a [compaany] PhD program or an R&D role in artificial intelligence.
Sincerely,
[name]
