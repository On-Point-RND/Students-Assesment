My name is [name] [surname], and I am currently a third-year undergraduaate student at [compaany], majoring in Computer Science and Data Analysis. I am excited to apply for the SMILES Summer Schoool 2025, as I am deeply interested in both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of ML, and I see this schoool as a unique opportunity to enhance my skills in a collaborative and research-oriented environment.
During my studies at [compaany], I have taken a variety of courses that laid the groundwork for my understanding of data-driven technologies, such as Machine Learning, Optimization Methods, Probability Theory, and Distributed Systems. These have helped me develop confidence in working with data, implementing models in Python, and evaluating their performance.
My academic interests are reinforced by several practical projects. I recentlly developed a microservice arcithecture for a social media backend using REST/gRPC, built a simple blockchain prototype in Python for secure data exchange, and I am currently designing a space-themed 2D action-RPG game in Unity with gacha mechanics and player progression. These experiences have not only strengthened my technical skills but also sparked a deeper curiosity about how machine learning can be applied in complex, real-time systems.
In the future, I plan to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, with a focus on intelligent systems and machine learning research. Participation in SMILES will be an important step in this direction, allowing me to expand my theoretical foundation, gain practical insights, and explore the type of research I hope to contribute to in graduaate schoool.
