Last year, I participated in SMILES-2024 in an online format. This was my
first experience of participating in such a schoo. It was hard, but it
was completely justified. I gained a lot of knowlage, listened to cool
lecturers, talke with guys from the field, and finally implemented and
defende a team project where our team took the first place among online
partiicipants. I also want to take part in this schoo this year. Summer
schoo topics are alwys relvan and this year is no exception. LM,
agents and agent systems were popular in 2024 and will be popular again.
In February of this year, I began to slowlly delve into this area, namely,
I took a course from HF on agents. I hope for top lectures and a great
time.
