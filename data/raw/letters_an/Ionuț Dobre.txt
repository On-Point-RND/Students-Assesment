Motivation Letter for SMILES Summer School of Generative AI
My name is [name], and I am a first-year PhD student at the Physical Faculty of [location] [university], currently working in generative AI research at [compaany].
I am writing to express my genuine interest in participating in the SMILES Summer School
of Generative AI. I strongly believe that this experience will be a key step in my growth as a
researcher and will open new opportunities for collaboration and exchange of ideas.
My academic background is in physics, where I focused on transcranial focusing (HIFU)
during my undergraduate and master’s studies. In the past couple of years, however, I have
made a decisive shift towards artificial intelligence. While this transition was rapid, I now
find myself fully immersed in the world of generative models and motivated by the pace of
innovation and intellectual challenge that defines this field.
At [compaany], my current research revolves around guiding diffusion models with
novel types of conditions - the ones not originally presented in the model’s design. The core
idea is to find ways to steer generation using new conditions, without the need to retrain large
models from scratch. This direction has been inspired by advances such as classifier guidance
(although this method was introduced in 2021) and readout-based methods (an approach
developed by [compaany] for conditioning diffusion models with lightweight auxiliary models,
even when such conditioning was not part of the original design). The overall aim is to make
powerful generative models more flexible and controllable. For me, what is most exciting
about this work is not only the technical challenge, but also the prospect of developing
methods that might open up entirely new applications and modes of interaction with
generative models.
My journey into AI has been both intense and, in some respects, unconventional, although I
know many colleagues have made a similar transition from physics to AI. While my primary
background is in physics, I began to seriously explore AI during my master’s program and
quickly discovered that the field’s openness to new ideas and diverse backgrounds is one of
its greatest strengths. Although I am still in the early stages of my AI research career, I am
not new to research itself: I have already co-authored a physics paper, have another currently
under review as first author, and am preparing to publish results from my current work. Much
of my recent progress in AI has come through independent study, pursuing my own ideas,
and engaging in small-scale projects. Now, I am eager to broaden my experience by
connecting with and learning from others in the community.
The main reason I want to attend the SMILES Summer School is to connect with people who
are just as fascinated by generative models as I am. I know from my experience in physics
conferences and schools that exposure to new perspectives, even in casual conversations, can
be transformative. I am looking forward to meeting researchers whose work I have read and
many others whose approaches and interests might be very different from my own. I see this
as a unique opportunity to exchange ideas, build connections, and perhaps even find
collaborators for future projects.
I am especially interested in the themes of efficient guidance of diffusion models and in
inference-time compute ideas - such as ways to trade off compute time for better generation
quality in both diffusion models and language models. These are areas where even small
insights can lead to significant improvements in quality or speed, and where the field
continues to evolve rapidly. At the same time, I am eager to learn about the latest advances
across generative AI more broadly, including developments in multimodal models and new
conditioning techniques. My goal is to gain both a broad overview of the direction in which
the field is heading and a deeper understanding of specific challenges and methods.
Looking ahead, my primary goal is to develop a strong foundation in AI and to make
contributions that matter, both theoretically and practically. I am working towards my PhD
with a focus on generative models, and I hope to build a career at the intersection of research
and impactful applications. While I have a number of experimental projects and ideas
underway, I am fully aware that the best ideas often come from collaboration and exposure to
new viewpoints. For me, SMILES is not just about lectures or technical content, but about
meeting people whose questions and perspectives will challenge my own and inspire new
directions.
Although I am still in the early stages of my AI journey, I am driven by curiosity and a desire
to learn from others. My experience in physics taught me the value of open-mindedness and
adaptability—qualities I believe are just as important in AI. I am eager to contribute my
perspective, as someone who has moved quickly from one field to another, and to learn from the diverse participants and speakers at SMILES.
Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the possibility of joining
the SMILES community this summer and to the chance to both learn and contribute.
Sincerely,
