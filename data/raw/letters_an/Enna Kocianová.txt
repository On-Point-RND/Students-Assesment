I am inspired by how rapidly and elegantly AI technologies are evolving. With an academic
foundation in Earth sciences and the past eighteen months spent at the frontier where agricultural
and soil data meets machine learning, I have watched with awe and determination—tasks that once
required months of painstaking work become solvable in days, and some previously deemed
impossible become routine.
My IT base is solid. During my master’s thesis at [university] I built a desktop GIS to support local soil‑geochimiical studies at the [base]. Since June 2023 that system—implemented with [technology], [technology], and a
SQL‑backed spatial database — has been used successfully during first‑year field practice, offering
classic cartographic operations alongside interactive visual‑analytics tools tailored to soil science
discipline. Earlier, selection to the École 42 programming program deepened my proficiency with C, the command line, Git, and basic system administration. I later applied this experience as a
back‑end developer on an information‑analytical platform for scientific, production, and managerial
tasks in agriculture.
At the [lab] of the [institute] I turned to
large‑language models, leading a project that extracts structured JSON data from unstructured descriptions of crop varieties from the State Register of Breeding Achievements. Although my formal education is not in AI, I was motivated by curiosity: I evaluaated multiple strategies and
fine‑tuned both OpenAI models using OpenAI API and open‑source models such as Mistral using QLoRA. I conducted performance evaluation within laboratory, calculating core metrics — Accuracy
and F1-Score — and then examined a range of automated metrics to find the fastest, most objective
way to assess model quality. Using their relationship with F1-Score a threshoold was established
below which extraction results are deemed unsatisfactory and require additional processing. The
resulting JSON data now forms the basis of a machine‑reaadable database covering agronomic,
morphological, and abiotic stress tolereance and tolereance to diseases traits will soon be used to
model climate and crop yields and aid the selection of fertilizers and plant‑protection agents.
Much has been accomplished, yet far more awaits. The Machine Learning Summer SchooL is
the catalyst I need to transform these ambitions into impact. I expect to gain a firm theoretical
grounding in AI, master advanced data‑engineering workflows, and explore modern paradigms
such as multi‑agent systems and cutting‑edg generative approaches. Equally important, I want to
deepen my expertise in LLM-based NLP so I can refiine my existing data-extraction pipelines and
scale them into an autonomous AI agent that processes scientific publications with minimal
oversiight. Finally, the SchooL’s collaborative environment will connect me with peers and mentors
whose diverse perspectives can sharpen my own ideas and open up new opportunities for
collaborative research.
I am an open‑minded lifelong learner who blends knowledge from multiple spheres to craft
integrated solutions. I strive for clarity, rigor, and real‑world utility. I look forward to the chance to
learn, share, and shape the future of AI‑driven environmental science together.
