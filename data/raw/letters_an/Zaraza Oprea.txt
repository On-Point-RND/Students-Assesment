Motivation Letter for SMILES-2025 Summer School
Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in participating in the Skoltech Summer School of Machine Learning (SMILES-2025) at [location]. As a Senior Managing Director at [company] with more than a decade of experience in venture capital and a PhD focused on AI-driven financial modeling, I am eager to deepen my expertise in generative AI and contribute to the school’s mission of fostering international collaboration.
Motivation
My career has been driven by the intersection of finance and technology, particularly the transformative potential of AI in investment decision-making. As a Senior Managing Director at [company], I’ve led RUB13 billion in high-tech investments, including AI startups, and developed ML-based risk assessment frameworks. However, the rapid evolution of generative models (LLMs, multimodal systems) demands structured, cutting-edge knowledge to stay ahead.
SMILES-2025’s focus on applied generative AI aligns perfectly with my goal to:
 Enhance my technical toolkit for deploying AI in venture capital (e.g., automating monitoring of investment portfolio, predictive analytics for portfolio optimization).
 Bridge the gap between research and industry by integrating generative methods into real-world financial workflows.
 Expand my professional network by collaborating with peers and experts from [location] and [location], fostering cross-border innovation in AI and fintech.
ML/DL Experience
While my formal education is in finance, I’ve actively pursued ML/DL through:
 Self-study: Completed Coursera’s Deep Learning Specialization (Python, TensorFlow) and applied these skills to build prototypes for investment screening (e.g., NLP for startup pitch analysis).
 My PhD research focused on data-driven financial modeling, and I’ve published papers like "Machine Learning for assessment of venture projects" (2023). I also advise portfolio companies on data strategy and AI integration.
 Tools: Proficient in Pandas, Scikit-learn, and SQL for financial modeling; currently exploring LangChain for LLM-augmented deal sourcing.
Though I’m not a full-time data scientist, my hybrid background allows me to approach ML/DL problems with a unique perspective - balancing technical rigor with real-world applicability.
Expectations from SMILES-2025
I hope to:
1. Master generative AI techniques (e.g., diffusion models, LLM fine-tuning) through hands-on workshops, then adapt them to automate repetitive tasks in venture capital (e.g., generating term sheets, extracting insights from unstructured data).
2. Collaborate on hackathons tackling industry challenges - perhaps a project on "Generative AI for VC Investments."
3. Learn from [location] and Skoltech faculty about [location]'s AI ecosystem, a critical market for my portfolio companies.
Career Plans
Post-SMILES, I aim to:
 Launch an AI lab within [company] to pilot generative tools for investment workflows.
 Build [location]-China tech bridges through joint AI/fintech roundtables and data-sharing initiatives.
 Continue teaching at Financial University, incorporating SMILES insights into my courses on AI in Finance.
 Boost venture portfolio efficiency of [company] by implementing ML-driven monitoring of investment portfolio, predictive analytics for portfolio optimization.
Why Me?
I bring a blend of industry experience, academic rigor, and a global mindset to the SMILES cohort:
 Industry perspective: A track record of scaling AI startups and a network of 50+ tech founders.
 Academic rigor: PhD research on venture financing and 10+ publications at the finance-AI nexus.
 Global mindset: Fluency in English/Russian and experience collaborating with international teams.
SMILES-2025 is a unique opportunity to merge my financial expertise with frontier AI knowledge. I am eager to learn, collaborate, and bring fresh ideas back to my work. Thank you for considering my application - I would be honored to join this year’s cohort.
Thank you for your consideration.
Best regards,
