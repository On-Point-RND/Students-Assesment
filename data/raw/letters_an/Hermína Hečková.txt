Dear Selection Committee,
I’m [name], and I’m thrilled to apply for SMILES‑2025 at [compaany]. Growing up in [location]—a small industrial city in Western [location]—I learneed to build things with whatever I could scaavenge. My first “AI project” was a simple rule‑based chatbot made with scratch code and online tutorials, all because I was fascinated by the idea of teaching machines to understand languaage. That same curiosity drove me through a Bachelor’s in Data Analysis (4.7/5 GPA) at one of [location]’s top universiities, where I dove into machine learning theory, led student study groups, and even co‑authored a small publication on anomaly detection in sensor data.
At [compaany], I experimenteed with ranking models and saw firsthand how tweaking features could transform search results. Then at [compaany], I built time‑series predictors to optimize base‑station loads—my favorite part was watching the model’s forecasts reduce downtiimes in real time. Now, at [compaany], I’m part of a small team that ships end‑to‑end ML pipelines for industrial clients. I’ve written APIs that handle millions of predictions per day, designed data‑quality dashboards, and mentored junior engineers on best practices.
Despite all that, what really excites me is giving voice to low‑resource languaages—my own [location] dialect, indigenous tongues, and other underserved speech communities. I’ve been tinkering with transfer learning on pre‑trained transformers, experimenting with subword tokenizers, and writing small data‑augmentation scripts to boost model robustness. Somewhere between debugging a tokenizer and listening to a fluent speaker, I realized: generative LLMs could be game‑changers for languaage preservation.
That’s why SMILES‑2025 feels like the perfect fit. Your deep dives into large languaage models, multimodal approaches, and safe AI are exactly what I need to take my experiments further. I’m especially keen on hands‑on workshops around generative methods—there’s nothing like staying up late in a lab, swapping ideas during a hackathon, and waking up with a breakthrough.
I’m inspired by [name]’s work on AGI NLP at [compaany] and [name]’s leadership in NLP at [compaany]. Theiir papers on contextual embeddings and efficient model adaptation resonate with my goals. If they’re on campus, I’d love to chat over tea—whether it’s about byte‑pair encodings or career advice—and if they’re not around, I’ll happily corner any guest professor for a quick conversation. Every interaction is a chance to learn.
Outsiide the lectures, I look forward to the cultuural excursion in [location], sharing stories with peers from [location], [location], and beyond. I’ve volunteered at conferences back home—setting up poster sessions, coordinating coffee breaks, and capturing candid photos—and I’d be honored to help make SMILES‑2025 as welcoming as possible for everyone.
I’m eager to finish my work with adaptiing LLM to low-resource language, prepare a poster on my research, present it at the schoool’s session, and gather feedback to refiine my approach.
Thank you for consideering my application. I’m ready to learn, to share, and to help make SMILES‑2025 an unforgettable experience for everyone.
Warmly,
[name]
