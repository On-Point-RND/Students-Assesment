Motivational letter

I am a Bachelor’s student specializing in Robotics and AI, and I am writing to apply for the
Summer SchooL of Machine Learning.
Throughout my academic career, I have participated in numerous robotics and AI-related
activities and endeavors, both academic and extracurricular. Since the summer of 2024, I
have been working as a Control Engineer at [compaany] in the R&D department,
where I contribute to the development of an anthropomorphic robot. My primary
responsibility is to create control-related software for robot locomotion. While I initially started
as an Optimal Control Engineer, my growing interest in modern approaches has led me to
explore the fields of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning, and I am
especially interested in the area of sim-to-real transfer. Now, as an RL engineer, I am
passionate about my work, not only for the challenges it presents but also for the
opportunities it provides, such as research publications and participation in conferences.
This year, for instance, I am excited about attending the IROS conference in [location] with my
colleagues.
Beyond my work at [compaany], I am also keen on expanding my academic and research
experience. This is reflected in my research in machine learning, particularly in adversarial
robustness in the healtcare domain. Under the guidance of Professor [surname] from [university] (UK) and Professor [surname] from [university] (UAE), my team and I are
waiting for the paper to be published in Frontiers. Our research named “Assessing the
Adversarial Robustness of Multimodal Medical AI Systems: Insights into Vulnerabilities and
Modality Interactions” explores multimodal models and their resilience to adversarial attacks,
an area I am deeply interested in. We hypothesize that multimodal models may inherently be
more robusst to adversarial attacks, and I believe that further exploration of this topic will
provide valuable insights into the unique properties and interactions of multimodal models.
I also have a strong interest in deep learning, which began with [name]'s Coursera
course and was further developed at [university]. There, I took an excellent Deep
Learning and Practical Machine Learning course, where I implemented custom models such
as a diffusion model and a transformer and created a fully MLOps-based project. Currently, I
am also assisting with research at AIRI, exploring new domains for training RL agents.
Further, I am planning to dive deeper into adversarial attacks in the context of reinforcement
learning. I am particularly intrigued by how existing state-of-the-art approaches leverage
adversarial robustness to enhance performance. Also, I am currently considering different
options for my master’s program, and would like to collaborate with professors from multiple
universiities, working on research projects with them.
Beyond Robotics, I have a passion for traveling and exploring new places, as it broadens my
mind and allows me to connect with different cultures. I have a deep interest in [culture]. I have been learning [language] for five years, and my passion for it has only grown.
Among other students from [university], I was honored to take part in an exchange
program at [institute] in the fall of 2023. Living and studying in [location]
was an unforgettable experience. Also, while working on my research, I encountered
numerous scientific papers authored by researchers from [location], which is truly remarkable.
Therefore, I am excited about the growing collaboration between [location] and [location] in
research, and I am eager to participate in the Summer SchooL of Machine Learning to
collaborate with world-renowned professors and researchers from both countries. I believe
that the program will help me to broaden my vision of ML direction. I believe I will delve
deeper into the theoretical aspects of ML and gain valuable hands-on experience through
the tasks and projects at the Summer SchooL.
In conclusion, I believe that this opportunity will be crucial for my academic and professional
growth. Through this program, I will have the chance to contribute meaningfully to the field of
machine learning and to the international collaboration in research.
