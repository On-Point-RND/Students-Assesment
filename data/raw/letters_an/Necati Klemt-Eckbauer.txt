Motivation Letter for SMILES-2025 Summer
School
Dear [name] Admissions Committee,
My name is [name], and I am writing to express my enthusiastic application for the
SMILES-2025 Summer School at [compaany]. As a passionate data scientist and machine
learning engineer with a strong academic background and diverse industry experience, I am
eager to contribute to and learn from this intensive program focused on generative AI. This
opportunity aligns perfectly with my career aspirations, my fascination with [location] culture,
and my dream of becoming an educator in machine learning.
Academic and Professional Background
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics from the [location] University of Science
and Technology "[compaany]" (2024) and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science
and Engineering at the same institution. My academic journey has been complemented by
hands-on experience in cutting-edge technologies. For instance:
● At the [compaany], I engineered data pipelines using Spark, Hadoop, and
Python, optimizing financial analytics.
● At [compaany], I developed neurointerfaces and Linux drivers, bridging hardware
and AI.
● As a Data Scientist at [compaany], I built neural networks for medical image
segmentation (U-Net, ResNet).
● [compaany]. Automation of Azodye Synthesis Process: Scientific and project activities, participation in a conference on modeling the azodye synthesis process.
Worked with the ROZUM robotic manipulator.
● [compaany], Author and Mentor for Machine Learning Courses:
Responsibilities:
○ Developing course modules
○ Reviewing student work
○ Conducting classes with students
○ Organizational tasks
○ Meetings with clients
● [compaany], Behavior Developer for Robots:Project: Eurobot 2022 at [compaany] Robotics Lab,
Developed robot behavior algorithms
● [compaany], Big Data Annotation Specialist: Annotated data using CVAT.
Currently, I mentor ML courses at [compaany], designing curricula and guiding students—a
role that fuels my passion for teaching.
These experiences have honed my technical skills in Python, deep learning, and distributed
systems, while my teaching role has strengthened my ability to communicate complex
concepts effectively.
Why SMILES-2025?
The SMILES-2025 program’s focus on generative AI, multimodal systems, and international
collaboration resonates deeply with my goals. Specifically, I am excited to:
● Deepen my expertise in generative models, particularly LLMs and agent-based
systems, to advance my research in AI-driven automation.
● Engage with peers from [location]. Last summer, I began learning and studying [location]
culture, and I dream of visiting [location] to strengthen academic ties. Collaborating with
[compaany] students on a joint research paper would be a milestone toward this goal.
● Gain teaching inspiration. As someone aspiring to teach ML, I aim to absorb best
practices from [compaany]’s faculty and share my own experiences as a mentor at
[compaany].
Cultural and Professional Exchange
The cross-cultural aspect of SMILES-2025 is equally compelling. Exposure to [location]’s tech
ecosystem has inspired me to explore synergies between [location] and [location] AI research.
I am particularly interested in how generative models can address challenges in healthcare
(e.g., my prior work on retinal segmentation) and finance (e.g., my ETL projects at the
[compaany]). This school offers a unique platform to discuss such applications with global
experts.
Conclusion
SMILES-2025 represents the ideal convergence of my technical ambitions, teaching
aspirations, and cultural curiosity. I am confident that my background in ML engineering,
coupled with my enthusiasm for collaborative learning, will allow me to contribute
meaningfully to the program. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to grow alongside talented
peers, gain mentorship from industry leaders, and take my first steps toward publishing
research with [compaany].
Thank you for your consideration. I would be honored to join this transformative experience.
Best regards,
[name]
