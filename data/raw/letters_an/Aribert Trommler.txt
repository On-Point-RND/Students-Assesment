Participating in SMILES is a valuable opportunity for me. First, SMILES covers topics that I am eager to learn about, such as large language models. By joining SMILES, I hope to systematically study the latest methods in these fields and improve my research skills. Second, this event brings together many experts and scholars from [location]. It offers me a chance to communicate directly with these experts and better understand the current trends and challenges in this area. Moreover, SMILES encourages participation from students in [location] and [location]. Therefore, joining SMILES will enable me to interact and share experiences with peers from diverse academic backgrounds.
I have previously studied deep learning and published three papers at international conferences listed in the [compaany]'s recommended international conferences and journals. I also presented these papers orally at the conferences. My previous research mainly focuses on computer vision and bioinformatics. Regarding computer vision, I have a good understanding of real-time object detection methods. In bioinformatics, I am experienced in biological signal processing techniques. I have strong coding skills, which allow me to quickly implement various models, turning my ideas into experimental models for testing and evaluation.
SMILES is a conference and school focused on generative artificial intelligence. Currently, deep learning is developing quickly, and generative AI is an important topic in this field. Researchers in deep learning should pay attention to developments in generative AI technology. My current research areas, computer vision and bioinformatics, can greatly benefit from large language models, generative AI, and multimodal methods. By attending SMILES, I hope to strengthen my knowledge and skills in these areas and to integrate these advanced techniques into my research.
Additionally, I hope SMILES will offer opportunities to interact with experts and students from different [location], helping me broaden my horizons and further enhance my abilities.
In the future, I aim to become a researcher. Although the path of scientific research is challenging, it is also filled with excitement and discoveries. As we live in a rapidly changing world, exploring new fields and contributing to technological progress is something I am eager and able to do. Scientific research also allows theories to become practical solutions, addressing real-world problems. Becoming a good researcher is certainly not easy: it requires deep knowledge, careful thinking, creativity, patience, and perseverance. I will continue to improve my research skills and knowledge through continuous learning, practice, and reflection.
