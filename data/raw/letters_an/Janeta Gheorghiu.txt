In order to improve my technical and research abilities in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL),
I am very inspired to take part in SMILES-2025. By using interdisciplinary appproaches, I hope to broaden
my knowledge and close the gap between physics, biology, and artificial intelligence (AI)
I am able to use and communicate machine learning concepts in scientific and educational contexts
thanks to my technological background and teaching expertise. I hope to gain knowledge of the most
recent AI techniques, work with professionals in the field, and participate in cutting-edge AI projects that
are applied to scientific research by joining SMILES-2025.
