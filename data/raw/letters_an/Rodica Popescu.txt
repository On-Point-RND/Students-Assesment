Hello. My name is [name], and I am an applicant for the [compaany] Summer School of Machine Learning (SMILES-2025). I am 40 years old and I am just at the beginning of my journey in the field of machine and deep learning. I was once very successful in the context of academic education, graduating from a uni[location] with a diploma with honors. Later on, I continued the learning process, although in other areas. In recent years, the rapid development of neural networks has made it possible to have a comfortable experience of working with them. For a few years I was only a user and a bit of a hands-on researcher mainly of LLM and diffusion generative models. Then my interest began to deepen, and I wanted not just to work with neural networks, but also to learn what they have “under the hood”, and to learn how to implement practical developments in solving real problems. Fortunately, my curiosity and ability to learn quickly have not gone anywhere, and now I am immersing myself in ML/DL sphere with great enthusiasm. Unfortunately, I do not have practical experience in this field yet, but I expect to gain it in the near future. Everyone has started somewhere. I see SMILES-2025 as an opportunity to acquire valuable knowledge and skills, to learn from leading experts, and to join the community of people who are literally on the cutting edge of modern technologies. For my part, I am ready to be a volunteer at the conference and provide as much help as I can in organizational aspects, as I have an extensive experience in volunteering and co-organizing events.
In addition, I would like to mention my interest in neurobiology and brain function, so I have chosen the topic of the connection between the principles of natural and artificial neural networks for the review of papers for presentation.
Thank you for considering my application and I look forward to participating in SMILES-2025.
