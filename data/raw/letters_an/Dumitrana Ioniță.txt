Dear [name] Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my strong interest in applying for the Summer of Machine learning by [compaany].
I have been deeply interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence since high school.
During that time, I studied the basic principles of machine learning through summer camps at [university], special events, and self-study. In high school, I came up with the idea to develop an expert system capable of solving geometric math problems. I made several attempts to implement this system using [language] and [language].
At [university], I took several courses related to AI. In the Artificial Intelligence course, we developed a generative system that could compose musical accompaniments. In the Machine Learning course, we studied the fundamentals of both machine learning and deep learning — including classic ML algorithms, neural networks, convolutional networks, and both supervised and unsupervised learning methods.
Additionally, my thesis is focused on the field of machine learning. I have been working with dimensionality reduction techniques such as UMAP, t-SNE, and others. I also apply heuristic optimization methods, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms.
Currently, I lead a team of software developers at an IT-for-medicine company, where we are developing smart operating rooms. These systems must be fault-tolerant and capable of handling peak loads, especially when multiple surgery recordings are being processed simultaneously. I am responsible for ensuring these product qualities, and I am excited to take on this challenge.
We collaborate with key organizations in [location], such as [organization], and with the government, both of whom are highly interested in applying modern AI systems to reduce the impact of human factors. [organization] operates the largest network of medical clinics in the country and sees great potential in reducing expenses by implementing automated analysis of on-site processes using AI. They can collect various types of data — text, video, audio, structured clinical data, and more.
However, I feel that the foundational knowledge I gained at [university] is not sufficient to tackle such complex projects. Therefore, I am eager to deepen my expertise in Artificial Intelligence to be able to work on more advanced and challenging tasks. I believe that the Summer School of Machine Learning at [compaany] will open new horizons for me in the field of AI and set a clear trajectory for further growth after the program ends. I’m excited to meet the other participants — passionate individuals who are pushing the boundaries of science.
Best regards,
