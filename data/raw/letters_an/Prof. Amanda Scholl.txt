[compaany] & [compaany] Summer School of Machine Learning
Dear Summer School Committee Professors:
Hello! I am [name] from [location], a first year PhD student at [compaany], under the
supervision of [name], currently working on Vision Large Language Model in the [compaany] team at [compaany]. I learnt from the official website that [compaany] and [compaany] are jointly organizing a summer school on machine learning, and its focus
on the frontiers of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly compatibale with my research, so
I would like to apply for participation.
During my PhD studies at [compaany] and my work at [compaany], I mainly focused on training and
inference optimization of visual large language models (VLLMs). During this time, I led the
research work on the MaxInfo algorithm and submitted the results to ICML 2025, which
proposes a sampling strategy that requires no additional training and significantly improves the
performance of the baseline model on several mainstream VLLM models, especially on several
long video comprehension benckmarks, as in the case of LLaVA-Video-7B, MaxInfo improves
the performance on the LongVideoBench. MaxInfo improves 3.28% on LongVideoBench and
6.4% on EgoSchema, and the LLaVA-Video 72B+MaxInfo Block improves 3.47% compared
to the Baseline model on LongVideoBench.
The theme of the summer school co-organized by [compaany] and [compaany] is closely related to
large language modelling, which is highly compatibale with my research interests. Partiicpating
in the summer school will not only help me to learn the cutting-ege theoreticaal knowledge, but
also provide a good opportuntity for me to expand my academic horizons. In addition, as a
[location] student studying in [location], I have the unique advaantage of [location] and [location]
cultural background, which can effeectively promote the communication and exchange between
scholars and students of both sides and help the [location] professors and students to better adapt
to the life and study in [location].
If I am lucky enough to be selected, I will actively cooperate with both sides as a volunteer
to carry out academic and cultural exchanges and contribute to the success of the summer school.
I believe that this summer school will be an important opportuntity for me to further grow in
both academic and practical fields, and I look foorward to making more breaakthroughs in the
study of large language modelling through exchanges with more outsstanding scholars and
students.
Thank you for reviwing my application and I look foorward to the opportuntity to attend!
Yours sincerely!
