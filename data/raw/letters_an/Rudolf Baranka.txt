Dear Admissions Committee,
I am excited to apply for the SMILES as it presents a unique opportunity to broaden my horizons in AI and collaborate with like-minded individuals. With a strong foundation in ML and DL, I am eager to be a part of this intensive program. Below, I outline my motivation, technical background, expectations from the school, and future aspirations.
My passion for AI stems from its transformative potential across industries and its ability to reconsider the common way of life. While I have gained substantial theoretical knowledge through my academic studies, I realise the importance of hands-on, project-based learning to bridge theory and real-world applications. This summer school aligns perfectly with my goals as it provides cutting-edge curriculum, practical challenges and collaborative environment
Through coursework and personal projects, I've completed a lot of ML projects which include data preprocessing, model training, and performance optimization, as well as DL (CNNs (Computer Vision), RNNs/LSTMs, Transformers (NLP applications)), Big Data and Advanced Python projects.
I am a Research Intern at the [compaany] International Laboratory of Bioinformatics. Currently, I am focusing on the neural network interpretation algorithms. Our team is preparing a publication on the topic “Robust Genomic Feature Selection Pipeline using an Ensemble of XAI Methods”.
My long-term goal is to become an AI Researcher or AI Engineer, that is why I believe this program will provide the perfect environment to enhance my skills and collaborate with the first class experts.
I am confident that my technical background, enthusiasm for AI, and collaborative mindset make me a strong candidate for this program. Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
