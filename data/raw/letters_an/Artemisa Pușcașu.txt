RE: Motivation letter for The Skoltech Summer School of Machine Learning
(SMILES-2025)
To whom it may concern,
I am writing to express my strong interest in participation in the SMILES summer school of machine
learning 2025, and to provide insights into my research aspirations and academic background.
My objective is to become a unique expert in applied Reinforcement Learning for real-world
applications. Attending the SMILES summer school will give an opportunity to deepen my expertise
in cutting-edge machine learning fields such as multimodal approaches, multi-agent systems,
generative methods, self-supervised learning, and safe AI. These areas represent the inevitable future
of artificial intelligence, and I want to stay connected with recent trends in these domains. Attending
high-quality lectures and hands-on experiences can significantly improve my knowledge and skills.
Additionally, I am excited about the opportunity to visit [location] and explore
its academic environment while also traveling and experiencing new cultures.
I commenced my academic journey at the [location] (MIPT),
where I obtained my Bachelor’s degree. [location] provided me with a comprehensive education in
mathematics and physics, offering fundamental courses such as Calculus, Mechanics, and
Statistical Physics, which form the bedrock for application in various research domains. During my
undergraduate studies, I gained diverse experiences, including conducting research on representations
of topologies in protein structures at the [compaany] in [location] and investigating
accretion-powered pulsars in the High Energy Astrophysics laboratory of the Space Research
Institute. Getting to know different areas of science helped me make an informed choice of research
direction, so, subsequently, to enhance my proficiency in maths and programming for data analysis, I
pursued my Master’s degree at Skoltech’s Data Science program, where I immersed myself in the field
of machine learning and cultivated a keen interest in Reinforcement Learning.
As a Research Assistant at Skoltech CDISE’s Advanced Multiscale Modeling Labo ratory, I had the
opportunity to explore the concept of Active Matter, which is instrumental in studying dynamic
systems of living matter, such as flocks of sheep or panicking crowds. My research during the initial
year focused on the physical properties of such systems, including the conditions of phase transitions
associated with the emergence of structural representations in the behavior of stochastic systems, and
the development of realistic numerical simulation techniques for these systems. Further, we applied
this research to the practical problem of efficient evacuation of panicking crowds. I was involved in
preparing the realistic simulation environment for a crowd of pedestrians, incorporating an additional
robot-leader agent whose task was to learn to navigate the crowd as expeditiously as possible.
Notably, during this work, I devised a novel solution to simplify the stochasticity of the agent’s task
through the special gradient encoding of the environment state, comprising the current positions of
pedestrians. The paper based on this work is currently under review, and I am hopeful that it will be
published soon.

Further, I was working as a Machine Learning Researcher within [compaany]’s HiSilicon Kirin CPU team.
My work is centered around processing sequential data, such as processor instructions, for CPU
optimization and, a bit higher level, LLVM-IR and compiler optimization (for example, BOLT), in
an industry that is still relatively new and quite confidential due to the proprietary nature of silicon
manufacturers. Our primary focus is on improving program performance, which can be achieved by
gaining insights into the complex multidimensional structure of the data. This almost invariably
requires the use of unsupervised approaches or the application of innovative ideas to gather and
further utilize crumbs of supervision. Consequently, my research is primarily directed towards two
distinct paths: the Markovian direction, where we learn Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) through
imitation constrained by limited time and memory consumption of the trained model, and the
representation learning direction, where we aim to derive transition functions to transform high
dimensional raw data into vector forms for subsequent clustering or other downstream tasks. The
intriguing complexity of working with such unique data has motivated me to explore and successfully
apply concepts from various fields, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Reinforcement
Learning (RL), Graph ML, and even Topological Data Analysis (TDA), on a regular basis. Work at
[compaany] showed me the needs of industries and how to fulfill them. However, I decided to return to
academy to dive deeper into research, publish research papers and learn from world wide experts.
Currently, I am working at [compaany]’s Adaptive Agents Lab (dunnolab), where we focus on learning
agents from raw videos. My current project involves object-centric latent action learning, where I
study how agents can learn meaningful actions by focusing on specific objects within their
environment. This approach combines ideas from generative models, reinforcement learning, and
self-supervised learning to create robust and interpretable systems. By breaking down complex scenes
into simpler components, we aim to build models that generalize better across tasks and
environments. The work based on the research will soon be presented at ICLR 2025 workshops.
My research interests have been shaped by my experience working with high-dimensional and
stochastic data to extract latent structures in unsupervised settings. This aligns with my broader
goal of uncovering meaningful patterns and representations from complex data, which has
wide-ranging applications. I believe that attending the SMILES summer school will provide me with
valuable insights into the latest advancements in machine learning and help me strengthen my
qualifications. The school’s focus on topics like large language models, multi-agent systems, and safe
AI matches perfectly with my career goals, and I am eager to contribute actively to discussions and
projects during the program.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
