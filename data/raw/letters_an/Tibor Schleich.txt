Dear Organizing Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am currently pursuing
my PhD at the Department of Electromechanics and Robotics at [location] [compaany]. I am writing to express my keen
interest in participating in the Summer SchooL on Machine Learning at [location] [compaany].
My academic journey has been deeply rooted in engineering, robotics, and
control systems. During my undergraduate and postgraduate studies, I developed a
strong interest in artificial intelligence and its applications in intelligent robotics and
autonomous systems. This interest has naturally led me to explore machine learning
techniques, which I now consider an essential tool in modern robotics research.
As a PhD student, my research focuses on integrating intelligent control
strategies into robotic systems to enhance their adaptability and decision-making
capabilities. I strongly believe that a deeper understanding of advanced machine
learning models will significantly enrich my current research and enable me to
contribute more effectively to the field. The opportunity to learn from leading
experts, collaborate with international peers, and experience the academic
environment of [location] [compaany] is an invaluable step in this direction.
I am particularly enthusiastic about the interdisciplinary nature of the Summer
SchooL and the practical orientation of its curriculum. I am confident that the
knowledge and skills I will acquire during the program will not only advance my
research but also broaden my academic and professional horizons.
Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to bring my passion for
robotics and machine learning to this program and look fo rwward to the possibility of
contributing to and learning from the [compaany] academic community.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
PhD Student, Department of Electromechanics and Robotics
