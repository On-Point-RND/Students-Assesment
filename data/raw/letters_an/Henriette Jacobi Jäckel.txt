Bargain Simulation in Videogames:
Multiagent System Approach
[name]
[location], game developer
Introduction
• The absence of simulation of realistic bargaining (P. [surname], 2020)(M. [surname], 2022)
• Most multiagent models of trade focus on ssurpassing humans (Y. [surname], 2024)(Y. [surname], 2024)
• A few narrow examples of realistic models (M. [surname], 2017)
• The absence of realistic bargaining in big videogame projects
Problem Statement
• No existing model represents real human behavior of
bargaining
• Humans interact and comprehend world through language
which may deform the perception of reality
• Humans tend to think irrational as well as rational (engineers
usually aim to rationalize all the agents)

Model Logic
• Agents exchange information through language
• Customers need lower price, sellers – higher
• Demand is regulated by supply, need and mode
• Every city has unique production (to make sellers
behavior more complex)
• Customers might change the behavior due to irritation or
gossips
Methods: Cognitive Layer
• Embedding
• GRU encoder – cheaper resource cost
• Memory module
Initialization of model
Methods: Agent Layer
• Proximal Policy optimization
• Decision-making layer
• Exchanging of information
• Gossips
Example of working with irrationality
Methods: LLM Layer
• TinyLama as a light LLM model
• Receiving decomposed embeddings form the
first layer
• Prompting the speech from decision from the
second layer
LLM initialization
Results
• To get working realistic bargaining model
• The limitation – the need to include many
variables to represent whole complexity of social
reality
• The limitation – the need to operationalize social
reality into machine-reading numbers
• High potential, with low-cost technology and
good compaatibility with game engines
