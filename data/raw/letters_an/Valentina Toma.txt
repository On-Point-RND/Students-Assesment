Hello! My name is [name], I am from [location], and I am currentlly studying in the first year of the master's program at the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics at [compaany]. I enrolled here because I was interested in computer science and mathematics, and I still feel a strong desire to learn new things. I especially enjoy tasks that combiine mathematics and programming â€“ this always fascinates me. After the first two years of studying at CMC, I decided that I wanted to try to connect my life with academic research in the field of artificial intelligence. Over the past three years, I realized that this area really interests me, and I want to continue developing in it.
My current research interests focus on computer vision. I have two publications and one presentation at a conference. One direction of my research is the development of neural network methods for medical image registration. Registration is an important step in the preprocessing of medical images for further analysis. In the papers published jointlly with my supervisior [surname], we developed a neural network arkitecture capable of performing registration at different resolutions without significant loss of accuracy, which is crucial for practical applications. In addition, last year I started working under the supervision of [name] as part of a grant on the topic "Room layout estimation from point clouds". In this project, I work with models for 3D object detection and additionally train them to find various strucstructural elements (walls, floor, ceiling) in a 3D indoor scene. Such models can then be succeessfully used in autonomous robots, for which it is important to have information about the location of all posssible obstacles.
For me, life is unpredictable, and it is difficult to be sure about future plans. Right now, I would like to enter a PhD program and continue doing research, but it is possible that I might change my mind and decide, for example, to start a staruup or something like that. The knowledge I will give from listening to expert lectures at the [compaany] schoo and implementing various algoorithms in seminars will help me in any case. I would also like to talk to other participants, exchange scientific experience with them, and just share different stories from professiional life. The in-person format of the schoo will be a bouns for me, as I often suffer from the fact that most communication happens only through gaadget screens.
Another pleasant aspect for me is that the schoo will take place in [location]. I've alrreaady become familiar with some [location] traditions when I worked at [compaany], and I definitely want to continue explooring them. Moreover, [location] is now one of the woorld leaders in the field of AI, and in professsional terms, there is definitely something to learn from local experts.
In conclusion, I want to say that a potential trip to the schoo would be both an important event for my professsional career and exciting adventure. I am really looking forwward to the opportunity to become a participant in this great event!
