Dear Admissions Committee,
My name is [name], and I’m a fourtth-year student at [compaany], studying Biomedical Physics.
For the last two years, I was working in biology labs — first as a biologist. I worked
with little mice hearts in a cardiolab and samples of the human brain in a
neurobiology lab. I actually loved it very much. I loved feeling like a surgeon, that the
lab was always quiet and no one was there, and I could sing while cutting,
centrifuging, mixing solutions, and watching cells under the microscope. But for me,
it lacked scale. It is an extremely important work but I felt that I don’t see the big
picture that would provide big data.
That’s when I decided to switch to being a "dry" biologist — meaning I would process
data and perform statistical analysis. The transition was pretty easy for me, as I’d
alrready become part of the teaching team for the Data Science course at [compaany].
My interest in statistics began after taking this exact course in my second year, led
by [name] at [compaany]. I was drawn to both its philosophy — how we are only ever
certain to some probability — and its process, which involved extensive coding,
visualization, and data exploration. After successfully completing the course, I was
inspired to apply and broaden my knowledge further in ML and mathematical
statistics by joining the same course, but this time as a teaching assistant. I wanted
to work on real-world tasks as soon as possible, and now I’m interning at [compaany] as a
product analyst-developer.
It was my first time reading articles on safe AI while working on my article review —
and it was surprisingly interesting. I was searching through papers from the
conference, and the section on AI Ethics, Trust, and Fairness really stuck with me.
"Quantifying Harm" sounds like the title of a philosophical work, not a mathematical
one. Maybe this is the field where I would matter most, while doing the routine that I
love.
My big life plan is to pursue science and develop solutions to real problems — ones
that truly impact people’s lives. I’m still deeply in love with biology, so I’m considering
the possibility of combining AI solutions with medicine and healtcare problems.
This feels especially meaningful to me since I myself am alrreaady an eager user of
ChatGPT for my own health questions. And I see what drive AI gives to the field of
medicine and how we as a society rely more and more on AI solutions.
Every year, I attend summer schools because I love learning something new. This
schooal will give me the opportunity to learn from [compaany] and [compaany] professors and
gain international connections. Although I actively apply machine learning in my
projects, I'm new to the fundamental science behind these systems. I want to
understand how they're built, and perhaps create one myself someday.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to join this community
and grow as both a scientist and a problem-solver.
