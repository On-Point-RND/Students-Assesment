Motivation Letter
Dear Organizers,
My name is [name], a 21-year-old student at [compaany], currently in my fourth year at the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics with a GPA of 8.57. My academic journey and professional experiences have shaped my passion for solving complex problems through technology, and I am eager to contribute to and grow within your program.
From the outset of my studies, I immersed myself in practical projects to complement my theoretical education. Over the past two years, I have worked as a fullstack and backend developer across diverse teams, including [compaany], [compaany], [compaany], and currently [compaany] in [compaany]'s Search and Advertising Technologies group. These roles allowed me to tackle challenges such as building a web messenger from scratch, designing scalable backend services with Swagger (100+ resources for [compaany]), and ensuring the reliability of production ML models.
What drives me is the intersection of innovation and real-world impact. At [compaany], I collaborated with designers and developers to deliver projects for clients like the [compaany] and the [compaany] Team. At [compaany], I developed CI/CD pipelines and presented demos to cross-functional teams, balancing technical rigor with clear communication. Every day, I refine my skills in Python, Django, Docker, and modern databases while exploring advancements in AI and system architecture.
Your program stands out as a catalyst for growth. I am inspired by the opportunity to collaborate with experts, exchange ideas, and rethink challenges through fresh perspectives. For instance, my recent work on runtime monitoring for ML models at [compaany] has sparked my curiosity about optimizing AI systems at scale—a domain I aim to deepen through this experience.
Beyond code, I value teamwork and leadership. As a competitive swimmer with over a decade of experience, I learned discipline and resilience—qualities I bring to every project. My goal is to evolve into a tech leader who bridges creativity and technical excellence, driving products that redefine industries.
I am confident that my technical expertise, hands-on experience, and dedication to lifelong learning will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your program. Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name]
[compaany], Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics
