Application for SMILES-2025 Summer School
Dear SMILES-2025 Selection Committee, my name is [name]. I completed my bachelor’s degree at the [compaany] Department of Integrated Cybersystems of the [compaany], and am currently studying for a master’s degree at the [compaany] Department of the Center for Cognitive Modeling.
I am currently working on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing on the navigation of a wheeled robot in a simulator. My master’s thesis is titled “Development of Navigation Methods for Robotic Systems Based on Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control.”
I am passionate about robotics and believe that artificial intelligence is alrready making a big impact in this field. In my laboratory, I study indoor robot navigation using RL, including approaches like curriculum learning and imitation learning based on heuristic algorithms.
I collaborated with a colleague who created scene graphs for our environments. Together, we submitted a paper to [compaany], and we are waiting for the results. I plan to share more details about this work during a presentation. The SMILES program excites me because it offers a chance to learn more about multimodal approaches, generative models, and self-learning methods. I want to apply these techniques to improve autonomous robot control.
In robot navigation, we collect data in different forms, such as images, scene graphs, robot speeds, or GPS data. This makes multimodal approaches very useful. For example, in our scene graph, each object has spatial coordinates and an image, while edges represent spatial relationships described by text. I believe multimodal models can help combiine these data types effectively. Generative models are also important for my work. They can create synthetic data when real data is expensive or hard to collect. For example, models like transformers can simulate a world model in model-based approaches or generate action sequences for an RL agent based on the current state. I know there are studies, including in our lab, that use transformers in RL, even if mostly in discrete spaces. These ideas inspire me to explore new possibilities.
I also like that SMILES takes an interdisciplinary approach. Robotics and AI combine many fields, and this mix is key to solving complex problems. By learning about the latest methods in other areas, I hope to find ways to improve my navigation algorithms. My current project is quite engineering-focused, combining existing methods, but I believe SMILES will help me discover innovative solutions.
I’m going to build a career in robotics by creating high-level control systems, and SMILES will help me achieve this goal. The schooal’s location in [location] and its focus on international collaboration are especially motivating. In my lab, I work with colleagues from [location] and [location], and I value the chance to meet people from other countries who share my interests.
Three months ago, I started learning [language], which makes me even more excited to join SMILES. I look forward to practicing my [language] and learning about [location] culture.
I am ready to present a poster about my robot navigation project, showing how RL can be applied in practice. Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name]
