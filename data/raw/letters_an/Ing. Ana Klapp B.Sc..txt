I'll be straight — my background isn’t a perfect fit on paper, but I care a lot and I learn fast.
When I joined [company], I planned to work on inter-satellite communication. Turned out, that
direction wasn’t really viable for me, so I switched gears. I tried a bunch of things, some worked,
most didn’t — and eventually, I got into computer vision.
That’s how I ended up choosing polyp segmentation in endoscopy for my thesis. I had zero
knowledge about polyps or segmentation at first, but I was curious and ready to put in the work.
Now, after almost a year in the field, I’ve realized that classic CV alone doesn’t cut it for me
anymore. I’ve started exploring generative methods and how LLMs are being used in vision
tasks. I’m especially interested in how diffusion models can be used for medical image synthesis
and how vision-language models might help improve interpretability in segmentation tasks. It’s
new, it’s messy, and I love it.
I’m applying to [company] because I want to go deeper into this direction — not to tick a box, but
to work with people who are serious about research and actually enjoy it. That’s the kind of
environment I want to be in. If I get in, I’ll make the most of it.
