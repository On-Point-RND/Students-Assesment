Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my sincere enthusiasm for the
SMILES-2025 Summer School at [location]. As a passionate researcher with extensive experience in artificial intelligence, competitive programming, and software development, I believe this program offers an unparalleled opportunity to deepen my expertise in generative models while contributing to the international AI community.
I graduated from the [compaany] school, which taught me an excellent mathematical foundation. Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Higher School of Economics ([location]), one of [location]'s leading universities, while continuing to expand my knowledge in machine learning through the [compaany] School of Data Analysis and [compaany] School of Software Engineering.
My research projects reflect both technical rigor and creativity: at [compaany], I developed a cat image generation system using GANs and implemented animal emotion recognition as part of a research project to identify optimal model architectures. These achievements earned me top academic marks and laid the foundation for my current role as a RAG Developer Intern at [compaany], where I build NLP-powered chatbots using large language models.
During my school years, I have distinguished myself in competitive programming environments, including winning in the final stage of the All-Russian Informatics Olympiad and reaching the final stage of the All-Russian AI Olympiad. My Codeforces peak rating of [randomized number] (profile: [name]) further demonstrates my strong algorithmic foundation and problem-solving skills. My 1.5 years as a PHP developer at [compaany] further honed my software engineering capabilities, while participation in five intensive programs at [compaany] Educational Center - including research shifts in mathematics and theoretical computer science - strengthened my analytical thinking and ability to tackle complex problems. On both shifts in mathematics and theoretical computer science, I made the best progress in the topics of unsolved problems.
I possess English proficiency at the B2 level, certified by "[Password Skills Plus]", which enables me to collaborate effectively in international settings. My experience organizing events for university open days and Olympiad tours has equipped me with strong teamwork and communication skills, making me eager to contribute as a volunteer at SMILES-2025. I would relish the opportunity to assist with media production, logistics, or other organizational tasks to enhance the experience for all participants.
The program's focus on generative models, multimodal systems, and safe AI aligns perfectly with my research interests and career aspirations. I am particularly excited about the hands-on workshops and hackathons, where I can apply my competitive programming background and mathematical training to real-world challenges. The chance to collaborate with researchers under the guidance of industry leaders would be invaluable as I prepare for master's studies in AI.
With my combination of technical expertise, research experience, and enthusiasm for community building, I am confident I can contribute meaningfully to SMILES-2025. I would be honored to join this dynamic program and help foster an environment of innovation and cross-cultural exchange.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the possibility of participating in this exciting initiative.
Sincerely,
[name]
