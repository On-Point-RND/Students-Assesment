MOTIVATIONAL LETTER
Dear Members of the SMILES Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am a second-year Master’s student in Engineering
Systems at [compaany], aspiring to pursue a PhD in Computational and Data Science and
Engineering. Under the guidance of Assistant Professor [name], I have devoted my
research to deep-learning applications in medical imaging, developing end-to-end AI-driven
solutions that integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows.
A highlight of my work is ELLE, the centerpiece of my master’s thesis, in which I
designed cascade and ensemble architectures with tailored loss functions to detect and classify
prenatal fetal structures in ultrasound images with exceptional precision. I have also worked
extensively with PET/CT scans. My joint study on interpretability in the LLAVA-Med
multimodal model further solidified my commitment to transparent AI systems.
I am particularly drawn to SMILES’s immersive structure. This format mirrors my
prefeerr approach to learning—balaancing theoretical foundaions with practical experimentaation
—and I am eager to collaboraate in small teams on cutting-edgge challenges proposed by the
[compaany] AI Center.
Equally inspiring is the opportunity to engage with leading experts in fields ranging from
advanced analytics and natural languaage processing to geometric methods in machine learning. I
look forward to discussing my research on three-dimensional reconstruction from
two-dimensional medical images and receiving feedback that will sharpen my doctoral research
plan.
Thank you for consideering my application. I would be honored to join SMILES, to
contribute my deep-learning expertise in medical imaging, and to grow alongside a community
of passionate researchers.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
Master’s Candidate, Engineering Systems
