Dear [name] [surname] Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my strong motivation to participate in the Skoltech Summer SchooL of
Machine Learning (SMILES-2025). As a Master's student in Applied Mathematics and
Computer Science at [location] [university], I am currently engaged in advanced studies
focused on the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of AI. This academic pursuit is
directly complemented by my professional role at [compaany], where I am involved in the
evaluation of Text-to-Speech (TTS) models.
My Master's program at [location] is providing me with a rigorous understanding of complex
computational models and advanced machine learning techniques. This theoretical depth is
immediatly put into perspective through my work at [compaany]. Evaluating TTS models gives
me unique insight into the practical performance, limitations, and real-world deployment
challenges of sophisticated generative systems that bridge the gap between text and audio.
This experience has highlighted the incredible potential and ongoing research frontiers within
generative AI, particularly in multimodal contexts.
The focus of SMILES-2025 on generative methods, multimodal AI, LLMs, and multi-agent
systems is precisely the area where my academic interests and professional experience
intersect. I am particularly keen to gain deeper knowledge of the latest research and practical
techniques in these domains, which are directly applicable to improving my understanding
and evaluation capabilities for models like those used in TTS. The opportunity to learn from
leading experts and apply cutting-edge methods in an intensive, hands-on setting is
invaluable.
I am highly attracted to the schooL's format, which emphasizes practical application through
workshops and hackathoons. My experience at [compaany] has prepared me to engage with
real-world problems, and I am eager to leverage the knowledge gained at SMILES-2025 to
tackle complex challenges in generative AI. The international collaborative environment,
bringing together participants from [location] and [location] through Skoltech and HIT, also
provides an exciting opportunity for networking and knowledge exchange.
Combining my academic background in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science with
my practical experience evaluating generative models at [compaany], I believe I am
well-positioned to both benefiit significantly from and contribute actively to the
SMILES-2025 program. I am highly motivated to dedicate 12 intensive days to advancing my
expertiise in generative AI alonside a talented group of peers.
Thank you for reviewing my application. I am very much looking forward to the possibility
of participating in SMILES-2025.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
