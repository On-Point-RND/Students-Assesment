Motivation
Generative artificial intelligence has reached an inflection point where the distance between
theoretical insight and real‑world deployment is measured in weeks. I want to spend those
weeks inside an environment that compresses the entire research‑to‑product loop into
twelve intense days—exactly what SMILES‑2025 promises. The joint Russia–China format
is equally motivating: the two ecosystems have complementary strengths (Russian
algorithmic rigor, Chinese industrial scale), and the School provides a rare neutral ground to
fuse them. My personal research on reverse‑engineering black‑box neural networks from
device telemetry benefiits from both perspectives: it is academically novel yet immediatly
useful for compliance and model‑safety teams in industry. SMILES‑2025 is therefore the
fastest path to critical feedback, new collabora tors, and GPU hours.
Experience with ML/DL Tools
● Core languages & stack: Five years of professional Python and C++/CUDA; daily
driver for prototypiing and high‑performa nce kernels. Comforta ble with JAX and Rust
for experimental work.
● Deep‑learning frameworks: PyTorch (primary), ONNX Runtime (infere nce
optimi sation), HuggingFace Transforme rs & PEFT (LoRA/QLoRA/BITFit), Lightning
for rapid experimenta tion. Contributed patches to PyTorch‑CUDA graph capture
utilities.
● Model domains:
○ LLM fine‑tuning & serving: Built LoRA pipelines for Russian‑langua ge Llama‑2
derivatives; integrated retrieval‑augmented generation with embedding‑based
selection.
○ Computer vision: Real‑time matting, segmentation and SR for broa dcasting;
GPU k‑medoi ds clustering for large‑scale image deduplication.
○ Recommender systems & tabular DL: Transforme r‑based cashback opti miser
deplo yed to 20 M users.
● MLOps: Docker/Kubernetes for reproducible training, Airflow & MLflow for
orchestration, Grafana/Sentry for observability, ClearML for experiment tracking.
● Data infra: AWS, Kafka, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, Elastic; designed cold‑path +
hot‑path feature stores.
This toolcchain has been pressure‑tested in commercial settin gs ranging from fintech to
classifie ds, so I can contribute battle‑hardened practices during the Schoo l’s hacka thons.
Expectations from the Schoo l
1. Deep dives that go beyon d tutorials. I hope lectures dissect fai lur e modes of
contemporary generative models, especially in multilin gua l and safety‑critical
contex ts.
2. Hands‑on multimodal labs. My goal is to leave with a prototype that aligns tex tual
and teleme try embeddings, leveraging the Schoo l’s multimodal GPU cluster.
3. Agentic‑system workshop. I want to experiment with lightweight agent swarms that
enforce policy compliance at generation time—a natural extension of my LLM
moderation work.
4. Cross‑cu ltural peer review. Honest fee dback from Chinese peers on scalability and
deploymen t constraints will stress‑test my research assumptions.
5. Career mentoring. I value real talk from facul ty who have balanced publication
pressure with buildi ng sustai nable research groups.
Career Plans
● Short term (≤ 2 years): Complete Ph.D. thesis and open‑sou rce a teleme try‑to‑graph
gene rative model; co‑author papers on transpare nt model monitoring; present at
NeurIPS Workshop on AI Safety in the Wild.
● Medium term (3‑5 years): Lead an applied‑safety lab inside a high‑i mpact tech
company, focusing on generative‑model introspection and compliance tooling.
Continue adju nct lec turing to seed the next cohort of ML engineers.
● Long term (5 + years): Establish a Russia‑China research consortium on
Hardware‑Aware Safe AI. Advocate for teleme try‑based governance as a lightweight
alтерна tive to invasi ve model audits; influence emerging AI‑safety standards.
Closing
SMILES‑2025 aligns perfectl y with my trajec tory: it is short e nough to ite rate rapidl y, intense
e nough to generate publish able ideas, and international e nough to validate them across
cu ltures. I bring production‑level generative‑AI experience, a track record of GPU‑level
opti mi sation, and an open‑sou rce etho s. In r eturn I expect to leave with sharper research
questions, concrete prototype milestones, and lifelong colla borators. I am ready to contribute
code, critique, and caffei ne.
