Dear Committee,
We live in a world of numbers. Code is embedded in each digit, and unlocking their patterns opens immense possibilities. This is how my love for mathematics began—a passion that led me to the IT field. I studied a bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at [location], followed by a master’s program in Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence at [location]. Today, I work as an Assistant Engineer at [compaany]’s RRI (Wireless Lab), where I bridge theory and real-world applications.
When I first began studying machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), the field was entirely new to me—both fascinating and challenging. I explored classical algorithms starting from linear/logistic regression, Random Forests, clustering, and coming to Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning, Policy Gradient Methods), even building an agent that learned to play table tennis. Later, I delved into advanced methods, starting with basic MLP’s and progressing to diffusion models and Transformers. I have learnt to work with libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow and completed a Big Data course, where we worked with Hadoop and Spark to develop a transaction fraud detection system.
I also gained experience with deployment tools like MLOps, a skill I aim to deepen further. Beyond technical training, I learned to critically analyze research papers and implement methods from scratch. For instance, I attempted a systematic literature review on text-to-image models, but the field evolved so rapidly that my work became outdated quickly. Later, I experimented with text-to-image diffusion models in a course project.
During my studies, I also took part in hackathons and additional courses. For example, my colleagues and I joined a [compaany] hackathon where we built “The Smart Search AI”—a document search chatbot using LLM’s and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). We deployed the project on Streamlit, and it earned us second place. Later, I completed the ML-PRO course organized by the Bank of Russia and VTB Bank. The first stage included weekly lectures and homework on topics like LLM’s, tokenization (how LLM’s process text), fine-tuning, and prompting. We then learned about Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). After passing this stage, I got into the second phase, where we worked on generating content from PDF files using OCR and NLP techniques. With this project, we presented at the Data Fusion Conference as guest speakers.
When I learned about the Summer School of Machine Learning, I knew I had to apply. The program’s focus on cutting-edge topics like LLM’s and agent systems aligns perfectly with my goals, and its location in [location]—a hub of technological innovation—adds immense value. I learn best in organized settings, so I value how programs like this turn complex ideas into clear, practical lessons. Meeting and learning from others—whether classmates or experts—is just as valuable, and I believe it’s one of the best parts of these events.
Summer school offers many opportunities. The challenging environment and teamwork will help me improve my technical collaboration skills and problem-solving abilities. No matter what I’m doing, there is always something new to learn, and I am excited to take this chance to improve myself.
Thank you for considering my application. Currently, I work in research, but I want to dive deeper into agent systems, LLM’s, chat systems, and ways to optimize LLM’s (like quantization). I believe I can contribute value to the program while gaining insights to advance my career. This experience will open up new opportunities in my field, and I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
