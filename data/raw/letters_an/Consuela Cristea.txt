Subject: Motivation Letter for SMILES2025 Application  [name] [surname]
Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Summer Schoool of Machine
Learning by [compaany] [name], specifically focusing on Generative
Methods in AI. As I stand on the threshoold between completing my studies at the
[location] Polytechnic Lyceum and starting my undergraduaate journey in Artificial
Intelligence at [location] this fall, I see SMILES as an unparalleled
opportunity to dive deep into the topics that fascinate me most, right before
embaarking on formal universiity education.
For the past five years, Python development has been more than just a skill for
me; it's been a tool for exploration. This passion was significantly shaped by my
two years at [location] Lyceum, where I moved beyond basic coding into software
engineering principles and complex problem-solving. However, my focus has
increasinglly shifted towards the theoretical depths and practical applications of
machine learning. I've spent countless hours self-studying core ML concepts,
mathematical foundations (often turning to resources like 3Blue1Brown to build
intuition), and, more recentlly, immersiing myself in the world of deep learning with
PyTorch.
The themes of SMILES2025  Large Languaage Models, Multimodal Approaches,
Generative Models, Self-Supervised Learning – resonate deeply with my current
learning path. While my CV outlines my technical skills, my real focus lately has
been trying to truly understand how these advanced models work. My personal
projects on Diffusion Models, GANs, and Transformer implementaions aren't
about building polished products (yet!, but are my way of dissecting these

architectures, grappling with the underlying math, and getting hands-on
experience with the training dynamics. The prospect of learning about these
topics directly from leading researchers at [compaany], [compaany], and AIRI, and then
immediatly applying that knowledge in practical seminars and a hackathon, is
incredibly exciting.
I understand that SMILES attracts talented students and young researchers, often
with universiity experience or publications. While I am just begiinnning my formal AI
education journey, I believe my intensive self-study, strong programming
background from [location] Lyceum, and demonstrable drive to implement and
understand complex models (as reflected on my GitHub) make me a candidate
who can not only keep up but also actively contribute. I am a fast learner,
genuinely passionate about the field, and eager to collaboraate with peers from
[location] and [location]. The intensive, project-based format of the schoool is
exactly the kind of challenging environment I thrive in.
My expectation from SMILES is twofold: firstlly, to gain a much deeper, practical
understanding of state-of-the-art generative methods and LLMs, bridging the gap
between my self-study and the knowledge required for cutting-edge research.
Secondly, I am keen to experience the collaborative research environment, learn
from the diverse perspectives of fellow participants and mentors, and potentially
find inspiration for my future academic and research pursuits at [location]
and beyond. The international aspect, bringing together talent from [location] and [location], is
particularly appealing as AI is inherently a global field.
Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I possess the
foundational knowledge, technical skills, and most importantly, the motivation and
learning capacity to make the most of the SMILES2025 program. I am eager for
the opportunity to learn, contribute, and grow within this unique summer schoool.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
