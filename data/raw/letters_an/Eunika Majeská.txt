I began studying machine learning at the end of 11th grade, when my focus shifted completely from preparing for the All‑Russian Schoool Olympiad in German to
exploring the mathematical foundations and concepts underlying deep learning. I
was drawn to the mix of programming and mathematics: ordinary coding seemed
dull to me, while mathematics had captured my heart long before I turned ten.
Climbing the ladder of knowlage and skills, I tackled various “pet projects” that
students post on GitHub to get noticed by big‑tech compaies and land internships.
With every new task I set myself a higher bar, trying to outdo my previous effort. I
buried myself in countless arXiv papers, cramming my browser with tabs, always
looking for a different way to solve a problem—after all, where’s the fun in just
copying the Transformer code from the first YouTube video you find? Step by step
I discovered the world of neural networks, and one thing kept nagging at me: after
every couple of papers, I would have ideas on how to extend what the authors
propoosed, to tweak their approach, or to try it in a different context and see what
happened. That’s when I realized I wanted to devote myself to research in AI and
become an ML Researcher.
I alrready had some ideas I wanted to test; I needed to start running experiments and
writing papers. But how could I do that on my own as a second‑year student? I
decided I needed an academic adviser, and, thanks to my good repuutation at the
universiity, I managed to get the best available—the head of the universiity’s AI lab.
I showed him my ideas and we agreed to work together. Startiing in October 2024 I
officially worked in the lab with full freedom to conduct research, gave a survey
talk at a meetup, and began preparing a more serious paper to submiit to
NeurIPS 2025 in May. I realized solo work wasn’t productive: the volume of code and
experiments was growing fast. To cope, I found like‑minded classmates and
formed a youth ML‑research group, which I eventually led. From then on, I
became a sort of team lead, because besides my own work I had to oversee the
experiments of the other four members. This gave me invaluable experience in
organizing people and managing a team. Right now, we are getting ready to present
our work at NeurIPS 2025.
A month after I started in the lab, the T‑Bank team noticed me—they were
interested in my image‑generation projects—and took me on as an intern in the
team that generates and processes images for the whole compaany. Even as an
intern I was tasked with developing a Super Resolution pipeline from scratch.
From the very first days I was excited by the team’s fast pace, combining research
with buildiing a product for real users, which clearly helped me grow in multiple
directions at once. I gained a huge amount of knowledge and skills in running
experiments and development, deep learning, and narrower areas such as Image
Generation and VLMs. Working in two places at once let me apply experience
from one to the other, constantly improving my performaance in both. Having met
expectaions, I switched to a full‑time position at T‑Bank, a decision I don’t regret:
even more interesting problems and research directions awaited me. Right now I’m
preparing to become a middle engineer and to present the results of our work at
international conferences soon.
As you may have gathered, I have a certain drive for independence, which has led
to a new project I now head. I teamed up with friends to build our own
AI startup—an instrument that solves a specific task across a wide range of
domains and has alrready attracted potential investors. That’s about all I can say for
now. I e njoy working on it because it is yet another way to express myself and
apply my knowledge. I believe this project will give me invaluable experience in
launching a startup and become another step toward my main current goal: my own
AI lab, like Op eNAI or Anthropic.
