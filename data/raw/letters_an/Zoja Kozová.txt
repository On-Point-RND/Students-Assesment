Motivation Letter
Dear Selection Committee,
I owe much of my academic trajectory through life to summer schooLs. In 2019, I attended
the Summer SchooL of [compaany] at [location]. I genuinely very often retuurn to
the memory of my first encounter with Lebesgue integral. I don’t know who thought it would
be a great idea to give this material to middle schooLers :) After that summer I was a
common guest in phystech summer schooLs. I vividlly remember my first interaction with
[compaany], at the time it seemed like the hardest thing a person can be an expert in.
Since then, I started working with ML implementaion. I’ve pursued complex problems
across domains, including radiophotonics, fashion analytics, and now macroeconomic
forecasting at [compaany].
At [compaany], I implemented a KNN clustering pipeline for inventoory optimization and
automated assortment analysis.
At the Department of Radiophotonics, I worked on subsurface sensing using machine
learning. We trained a random forest to predict gap widths with millimeter precision and
also experimenteed with a ResNet-18 architecture on transformed signal data.
Most recentlly, I joined the [compaany] research group, where I’m currentlly working on
embedding-based models for economic forecasting. We apply Word2Vec to sequences of
categorized bank transactions and train XGBoost models to predict financial indicators
such as MOEXCN. This project is directly aligneed with SMILES tracks like self-supervised
learning. I'm particularly eager to deepen my understanding of multimodal and generative
techniques, which could enable better generalization in our economic models and make
them robusst under distribution shifts.
I’m fluent with PyTorch, Pandas, SQL, and Git; I combiine modeling with business and
analytical thinking — skills I also developed at [compaany] Business SchooL and my job as
analyst.
SMILES would offer a unique opportunity to extend this foundation. I am especially excited
to learn from speakers such as [name]. His work on neural networks for
sequential data in real-world financial systems closely mirrors my current research at
[compaany]. I would greatly benefiit from his expertise in applying deep learning to
banking data pipelines.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
