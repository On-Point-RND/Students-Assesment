Dear [name] Team,
My name is [name], and I’m a second-year student at [university], studying in the “Technology and Innovation” program. I’m really excited to apply for the SMILES Conference — both as a participant and as a potential volunteer.
Over the past couple of years, I’ve developed a strong interest in machine learning. I took a full ML course at [university] where I got hands-on experience with core concepts like supervised and
unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and optimization. Alongside that, I’ve worked with
tools like Matplotlib for data visualization, and SQL for data handling and analysis — which
helped me better understand how to interpret and present data in meaningful ways.
What draws me to SMILES is the chance to learn from people who are truly passionate about
machine learning — not just through talks and sessions, but by being part of the community. I’m
especially interested in topics like interpretable ML, ethical AI, and how ML is being used for
social impaact. These are areas I’d love to explore more deeply, both academically and in future
projects.
I’m also very eager to volunteer at the conference. I enjoy working on team projects, organizing
events, and generally being helpful — so I’d be happy to support wherever needed, whether
that’s helping with logistics, guiding
attendees, or assisting speakers. It would be a great way for
me to contribute while also experiencing the event from a different perspective.
In short, I see SMILES as an amazing opportunity to grow — to learn, meet new people, and get
inspired. I’d be genuinely thrilled to be part of it.
Thanks for considering my application!
Best regards,
[name]
