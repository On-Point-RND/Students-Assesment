Motivational letter for SMILES 2025 summer school of machine learning
[name] [surname]
Dear selection committee,
I was working on deep learning infrastructure last 4 years.
I started as machine learning engineer at [compaany] (largest cloud in [location]), there I R&D several
new services: spark jobs, elastic deep learning and enhance inference service with triton
inference server and infrastructure-level optimizations.
Next, I went to [compaany] R&D department, where I developed universal transport framework
(allows use tcp, shared memory, cuda-ipc and infiniband automatically under same API).
It now allows guys to squeeze maximum available bandwidth from available transport topologies.
We integrated it to online learning pipeline for async embedding training. This work was also my
master thesis at [compaany].
Now I have beautiful opportunity to work on deep learning infrastructure research at [compaany] as full-
time research engineer and working on my PhD at [compaany] under [surname] [name]'s and [name] [surname]'s supervision.
I see my future to continue research on training and inference systems for deep learning.
They are getting more and more practical importance, and I see lots of research opportunities
in this area.
For me, there was always easy to generate new ideas for exploring.
But, working at [compaany], I collected one of the best insight of year about how to do research:
Best ideas come from collaborating with applied and theoretical researchers.
Sometimes they have inefficient implementations, but don’t really want to do optimization or
don’t know how (it is not their main job). This way one collaboration at [compaany] started: I develop
diagonal grouping algorithm for recurrent memory transformers. Now we trying to adopt it
internally and do finishing experiments.
In cooperation with theoretical guys, I see potential for theory-implementation co-design.
Now we are working in collaboration on async gradient methods: I help with experiments and
implementation of framework.
So there comes my main motivation for going to SMILES summer school:
the more I communicate with guys from different research directions, the more cool ideas and
possible collaborations I will potentially have.
This why I am excited to submit.
From my side, I will be happy to share my knowledge with applied researchers and
mathematicians from the practical side of their research path.
Will try my best to help them to achieve their results, with future collaboration or just ideas and
expertise.
Thank you for considering my submission!
