Dear [name] [surname] Admission Committee,
I am writing to you with great enthusiasm to apply for the SMILES Machine Learning School this summer. My name is [name] [surname], I am a bachelor of Applied Mathematics, [compaany], and I am currently doing research in the area of recommender systems, generative AI, and model interpretability.
I started working in machine learning since 9th grade and ever since I constantly improve my skills: attend hackathons and professional competitions, study new courses, participate in scientific schools and follow the latest trends in AI to keep up with the development of this field. My experience and expertise reflect well on my projects and research:
• At this point there have been submitted 2 academic articles to the RecSys 2025 conference with my co-authorship, one as part of the scientific collaboration with [compaany], and the other one is described in my presentation in the school application. Furthermore, two papers are being prepared for submission or research, first one is about inclusion of negative feedback in the recommendation models as a negative prompt and the second one describes the diffusion approach in recommender transformers.
• I worked on the Customer Context project during my internship at [compaany], which is a set of solutions for extracting entities representing customer wishes and needs at the moment from phone conversations. My tasks were related to the LLM-based solution. This project took first place in the team nomination at the [compaany] RnD Science Award.
• I also work on the "text2sign" project. This is a sign language generation project.
I am planning to apply for the Master’s degree in [compaany]'s in the field of 'Data Science', and since SMILES Summer School is organized by [compaany], it would be a great opportunity to get acquainted with its students and professors, which is why I am highly interested in attending it. I was also attracted by the fact that this year SMILES is international, which is a good chance to expand my professional connections and acquire new opportunities for collaboration. And most importantly, I was drawn to science school topics, I am particularly interested in topics on generative approaches, large language models and multi-agent systems. These topics overlap with my projects and research.
I believe that participating in SMILES will provide me with a unique opportunity to broaden my theoretical knowledge, gain valuable practical skills under the guidance of leading experts, and exchange ideas with similarly enthusiastic students and experts. The experience and knowledge provided by this school will be a valuable step towards my future career and new research. I believe that my enthusiasm, analytical skills and commitment to continuous learning will allow me to contribute to the scientific community. Thank you for considering my application.
