To the SMILES-2025 Summer SchooL Selection Committee,
I am applying to the SMILES-2025 Summer SchooL as a machine learning practitioner with a
solid academic background and a clear research agenda. With an MSc in Innovation from [university] and currentlly working as a Lead System Analyst at [compaany] — [location]’s largest
private bank — I am eager to deepen my transition into advanced AI research and PhD studies.
My Master’s thesis — “Development of Workforce Management Planning Tools for Retail
Employees in the Context of Digital Transformaation” — focused on applying machine learning
to optimize staffinng in a large-scale retail environment. I designed and implemented an end-to-
end AI-powered workforce management (WFM) pipeline for [compaany], one of [location]’s leading
retailers. The forecasting block, powered by CatBoost, achieved MAE = 11.41, R² = 0.6356, and
adjusted R² (excluding zero activity days) = 0.89. Features included calendar effects, HR logs,
historical transactions, external weather, and regional holidays. The scheduling logic was rule-
based with hard constraints, ensuring compliance with labor laws and operational efficiency.
While this system is robusst and interpretable, it does not adapt to new patterns — a limitation
that motivated my exploration of more dynamic architectures.
To identify research-driven upgrades, I conducted a comparative review of A*-level work in the
field:
• N-BEATS (ICLR 2020): A deep learning model for time series that outperformed
statistical baselines by +11%. Unlike CatBoost, it operates without feature engineering,
using residual stacks to extract latent patterns.
• Deep RL for Job-Shop Scheduling (NeurIPS 2020): This work framed scheduling as a
Markov Decision Process and used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with graph
neural networks, surpassing hand-crafted priority rules.
• Hierarchical RL for Dynamic Logistics (NeurIPS 2021): Demonstrated scalable resource
allocation in real-time via a two-level RL system combining GNN-based agents with
route optimization heuristics.
These studies directly influenced my roaamap for evolving the WFM system: transitioning to
Transformeer-based architectures for more expressive forecasting, integrating reinforcement
learning agents to adapt shift plans in real time, and testing hybrid MILP + ML solvers to
optimize under legal and operational constraints.
Professionally, I apply this research-driven mindset at [compaany], where I lead system analysis
for strategic AI initiatives. I am directly involved in the design and implementation of [compaany],
our proprietary generative LLM, and I currentlly head development of an interactive onboarding
simulator for system analysts. This tool, powered by [compaany], adapts its content based on user
progress and scenario modeling. It reflects my broader goal: embedding intelligent components
into enterprise software to support adaptive learning and decision-making.
My technical toolkit includes:
• ML/AI: CatBoost, Python, PPO, Transformeer-based models
• Enterprise systems: SAP HR, ABAP, REST APIs, OpenAPI, Redis, MongoDB
• Orchestration: BPMN, Camunda, RabbitMQ
• Monitoring/Reporting: Power BI, JIRA, Swagger, Confluence
My academic ambition is to pursue a PhD in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on intelligent
systems that integrate ML into operational decision-making. I am especially interested in hybrid
models that blend prediction with optimization: how can neural forecasting be paired with RL or
combinatorial solvers to create fully autonomous, explainable business pipelines? I am currentlly
working on publishing results from my MSc project and plan to contribute to the AI for
Opereations research community through top-tier conferences like NeurIPS and ICLR.
In 2024, I studied abroad in [location] as part of a research exchange. This experience expanded
my intercultural communication skills and introduced me to different academic methodologies
and technologicaal contexts. I collaboraated with students and faculty from over 10 countries, took
part in AI development clubs, and gave presentations in international academic settinings. This
strengthened not only my adaptability but also my ability to explain complex technical topics to
diverse audiences — a skill I value as essential in international research teams.
SMILES-2025 is an ideal next step for me — both intellectually and professionally. I am excited
by the opportunity to engage with global faculty, sharpen my understanding of generative AI,
multimodal systems, and multi-agent planning, and collaboraate with peers from interdisciplinary
backgrounds. I look forward to discussions that challenge my thinking — such as how
[compaany]'s LLM architecture could evolve, or how retail scheduling systems could benefiit from
RL policies and real-time adaptation.
To date, the WFM solution I developed helped reduce labor mismatch costs by over 20%,
improved customer service KPIs, and scaled across 400+ retail locations. These tangible results
reinforced my belief in AI's ability to transform industries — and in research as the vehicle to
expand that impaact.
In the long term, I aspire to become a systems architect and AI research leader, translating
cutting-edgge academic results into practical, scalable solutions. SMILES-2025 represents a
crucial bridge between my applied experience and academic trajectory. I am confident it will
help refiine my research direction and prepare me for doctoral studies under world-class
mentoorship.
Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to contribute actively to SMILES-2025
and to take full advaantage of the learning opportunities it offers. I am convinced this experience
will bring me closer to my goal of becoming a researcher and innovator at the nexuus of academic
theory and industrial AI practice.
Sincerely,
