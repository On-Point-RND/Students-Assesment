Motivation Letter
My name is [name], and I am writing to express my interest in applying for the Skoltech Summer School of Machine Learning. I have a strong background in mathematics and statistics, holding a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [location], which is ranked among the top 350 in mathematics worldwide, where I graduated with distinction. I then pursued my Master's degree in Mathematics from [location], ranked among the top 140 globally in the field. Currently, I am enrolled in the MSc Data Science program at Skoltech, under the supervision of Prof. [name], Head of the Biomedically-Informed Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. My research focuses on data-driven approaches using explainable artificial intelligence for cancer diagnosis. In this work, I analyze diverse medical data types, including CT scans, peripheral blood smear images, and clinical records. My goal is to develop novel models for diagnosing various types of cancer—such as lung cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and ovarian cancer—that not only provide highly accurate predictions but also offer clear explanations behind those predictions. These models highlight tumor regions that are clinically significant. By combining prediction and interpretability, such models can build trust with doctors and have strong potential for adoption in real clinical practice.
I have extensive experience in both machine learning and deep learning, including work with generative AI, transformers, and large language models. Over the years, I have completed several academic and applied projects in this domain. One notable experience was a two-month internship with “[name]” in collaboration with the University of [location]. Under the mentorship of Prof. [name] from Skoltech and healthcare professionals from the University of [location], we developed explainable deep learning algorithms for identifying pathologies in fundus images. This project involved advanced preprocessing methods to enhance medical data quality and the implementation of interpretability techniques such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, Score-CAM, LIME, and SHAP to visualize key diagnostic regions. In addition to practical work, I have contributed to the academic field with several research publications in machine learning and explainable AI. One of my papers is titled " A Data-Driven Approach with Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Customer Churn Prediction in the Telecommunications Industry." I am the first author of this work. It was published in March 2025 in a Q1 journal with an impact factor of 6, ranked among the top 6% on the Web of Science. In addition, I have multiple research papers published in top-quartile (Q1/Q2), which further reflect and strengthen my experience in machine learning.
One of my main motivations for applying to summer school of machine learning is that it is organized by Skoltech, an institution renowned for its high-quality and transformative academic events. Every event hosted by Skoltech is not only academically enriching but also highly practical. During my time as a student at Skoltech, I have gained valuable insights and hands-on experience through these events. I am confident that this summer school will be no exception. Its collaboration with the Harbin Institute of Technology and its emphasis on international exchange offers a unique opportunity to engage with leading researchers and like-minded peers from around the world.
Another key motivation for me is the opportunity to learn once again from exceptional mentors and scientists. Prof. [name] has played a central role in shaping my understanding of machine learning, and I have gained valuable insights into generative AI through the teachings of Prof. [name]. Additionally, under the supervision of Prof. [name], I was able to gain real-world industrial experience, particularly in healthcare-related AI applications. Being part of SMILES-2025 will allow me to continue learning under their guidance and further deepen my expertise.
Moreover, I am also highly interested in contributing to this event as a volunteer. I see it as a unique opportunity not only to enhance my academic and practical understanding of machine learning but also to gain experience in organizing academic and social activities. Such involvement will help me grow both professionally and personally, and I believe it will be valuable for my future career and leadership development.
I look forward to deepening my knowledge in generative AI, multimodal methods, and large language models through lectures, workshops, and hackathons. I am especially eager to collaborate with international participants and to learn from world-renowned scientists and mentors. I believe this experience will significantly contribute to my academic and professional growth. Presenting a poster with the results of my research and receiving expert feedback will also be immensely valuable for my future studies and career path.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
