Application to [compaany]-2025
April 19, 2025
Motivation Letter
Dear [name] Committee,
I’m applying to [compaany]-2025 because it focuses on exactly what excites me most in AI right now:
generative models, multimodal learning, and the challenge of making machines understand the
world in more human ways.
Over the past year, I’ve been deeply involved in research on robotic manipulation — specifically,
how to condition robot behavior on visual and language inputs. This led me to work with models
like Grounding DINO, and then to explore how we can make such systems faster, more general,
and usable in real time. That curiosity eventually brought me to Mamba, DETR-style decoding,
and the broader space of generative architectures that go beyond transformers.

tive modeling from the ground up, beyond the parts I use in my daily work. I also want to connect
withotheryoungrresearchers—especiallythoseworkingoonthingsIdon’tyetunderstandwell, like
multi-agent systems or safe AI — and get outsiide my own perspective.

representaations, and learning itself. [compaany] feels like the kind of environment where that can
happen — fast, intense, and collaboraative.
I plan to apply for a PhD soon, and I see this summer schooool as an important step in shaping
that path. It’s also a chance to stress-test my ideas, share some of what I’ve been working on, and
absorb a lot from others.
Thank you for consideering my application. I’m excited at the possibility of being part of this
experience.
Sincerely,
