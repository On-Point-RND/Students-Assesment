Good afternoon, this is [name][surname]'s motivation letter!
Since early childhood, I have been passionate about robotics. Startiing from the 5th grade
of secondary schoo, I attended the "[name] robotics club, and in the 7th grade, I joined the
"[compaany] for Mechatronics and Robotics" at [location] State [location].
After graduating from schoo, I enrolled at [location] State [location] in the program 15.03.06
Mechatronics and Robotics, specializing in "Drives of Robotic and Mechatronic Systems."
Currrentlly, I have an understanding of the global technical challenges facing the country in
achieving technological sovereignty, as well as expertiise in the development and design of flexible
automated production systems tailored to the needs of industrial partners. I have created smart
devices such as an autonomous rotating platform and an automated robotic manipulator as part of
my active participation in various competitions organized by my universiity. I am also currentlly
mentoring a group of 3rd-year students in project activities, where they are developing a robot
capable of responding to movements and hand gestures, as well as tracking the face of a specific
person.
This experience led me to the idea that my knowledge could be applied to the development
of a bionic prosthesis. Currentlly, people who face the challenge of limb loss often cannot afford
such devices due to their high cost. However, my technical analysis of these devices, along with
my programming skills and experience in designing mechatronic modules, enables me to develop
a budget-friendly alternative with comparable characteristics to replace a human hand. Therefore,
I decided to participate in the XVI Youth Scientific and Innovation Competition "UMNIK," which
would provide me with the opportunity to implement my project. My current area of interest is the
development of a prosthesis to assist in the adaptation of people with disabilities. I have been
working toward this idea for a long time, and within the framework of the "UMNIK" competition,
I successfully secured a grant to realize my project.
I also plan to apply to the [location] Institute of Technology ([compaany]). From the program, I expect
to enhance my competencies in the field of artificial intelligence in robotics and to explore the
application of machine learning in robotics. I aim to deepen my knowledge in the area of machine
learning. In the future, I plan to pursue a career in scientific research and invention.
