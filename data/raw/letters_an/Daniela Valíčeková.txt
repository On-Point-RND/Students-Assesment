Hi! My name is [name] and I do my research work in the field of chemistry. What does machine learning have to do with it? It seems to me that machine learning methods are very limited to applications in computer vision and large language models. Their potential for application is much wider, and we can use them to approximate complex functions, including the interaction potential of nuclei and electrons in molecules, to calculate chemical reaction profiles and much more! For me, participating in this school is to discover the possibilities of exactly this broad and multifaceted application of machine learning in chemistry. I think that the use of machine learning along with the explicit inclusion and consideration of the laws of nature (physics, chemistry, biology) will help people achieve the desired scientific and technological results much faster, because it is this explicit consideration that makes the model more “natural” and, most importantly, interpretable, which is very important for the discovery of new laws and phenomena in nature. This is exactly why I would like to participate in this summer school. Thank you!
