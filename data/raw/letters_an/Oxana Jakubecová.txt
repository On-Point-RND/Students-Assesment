Dear [name] of the [compaany] Summer School,
I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the SMILES Summer School on Machine Learning at [compaany]. With a solid academic foundation in applied mathematics and informatics, practical experience developing computational models for the oil industry, and a keen passion for deep learning, I am eager to deepen my understanding of AI methodologies and contribute actively to the program.
Academic Background
I graduaated in 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and Informatics from [location] [university], where I specialized in Mathematical Modeling and Computational Mathematics. My undergraduaate curriculum equipped me with rigorous training in numerical methods, differential equations, and data analysis. Currrently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Informatics at [location] [institute], specializing in Data Science. At [location], I have honed my skills in statistical learning, optimization, and large-scale data processing, and I am now eager to extend that knowledge by mastering state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
Research and Publications
During my studies, I explored the application of time-series analysis to quality monitoring in the food industry and different chemical experiments, resulting in three peer-reviewed publications:
1. “Application of Voltammetric Time Series in Monitoring the Quality of Dairy Products” (eLIBRARY ID: 56574998)
2. “Analytical Capabilities of Current Time Series of the Cu-Al Electrode in Dairy Product Recognition” (eLIBRARY ID: 63797629)
3. “Current Time Series of a Percolation Sensor under Chronoamperometric Conditions of Liquid Media” (eLIBRARY ID: 68637484)
These projects not only sharpened my expertise in signal processing and time-series modeling but also demonstrated the powerful role that advanced algorithms can play in real-world monitoring and classification tasks.
Professional Experience
From September to December 2023, I worked as a Technician at [compaany], where I developed nonuniform computational grids for reservoir simulation. This role required precision in numerical discretizaion and a thorough understanding of fluid dynamics within porous media. Since March 2025, I have been employed as an Engineer at [compaany], designing mathematical models for industrial oil-field equipment. Here, I combine theoretical modeling with software implementation, optimizing algorithms to improve performance and reliability under harsh operating conditions.
Motivation for SMILES Summer Schoo
The SMILES Summer School’s intensive curriculum in deep learning, hands-on workshops, and cutting-edge research seminars align perfectly with my goal of transitioning from classical computaional modeling to modern AI-driven solutions. I am particularly excited by the opportunity to work with faculty and peers on projects involving neural network architectures, reinforcement learning, and dynamic system modeling. I believe that the collaborative environment at [compaany] will accelerate my ability to apply deep learning techniques to industrial and scientific problems.
Future Goals
Upon completion of the summer schoo, I plan to integrate advanced deep learning methodologies into ongoing research at [location] and future roles in the energy sector. My long-term objective is to lead interdisciplinary teams that harness AI to optimize resource extraction, process monitoring, and predictive maintenance—ultimately contributing to safer, more efficient, and more sustainable industrial operations.
Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my strong mathematical background, practical modeling experience, and passion for AI make me a good fit for the SMILES Summer School. I look forward to the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with the distinguished [compaany] community.
Sincerely,
