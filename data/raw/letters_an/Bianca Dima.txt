Dear [name],
My name is [name], and I am currently in my final year at the Faculty of Biology and [compaany]. Yes, that is not a typo — I really study biology. After my first year, I worked for more than a year as a cell and molecular biolo gist at the [compaany] of Molecular Technologies at the [compaany] of Bioorganic Chemistry of the [location] Academy of Sciences. While this may seem like a typi cal early biology internship, for me it was a deli berat e c hoi ce — I wanted to gain a deep, hands-on understanding of how biolo gical data is actually generated. I believed (and still do) that to become a truly effe ctive compu tational bio logist, I first needed to experience the nuances, limitations, and compl exities of experimental science firsthand.
Later, in my s econd year, I enrolled in an additional educational program focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence, which sparked a strong interest in the field. Since then, I have been actively developing my skills through open courses, such as a course in NLP offered by the [compaany] of Data Analysis, and by regularly reading recent publications.
Over the past year I worked as a bioinformatici an at the [compaany] of Molecular Physiology at [compaany], where I applied my kn owl edge to process biomedical data such as RNA-seq and metage nomics datasets. At the same time, I con sis tently sought to incorporate machine learning app roaches into my projects. One of the most i mpactful projects I contributed to was a colla boration with the [location] Oncology Hospital, where we deve loped a neural ne twork for diagnosing tongue cancer. This gave me va luable experience in computer vision and in dealing with the compl exities of real-wor ld biomedical data. And I am cur rently writing my bachelor's thesis on using recomme nder system models to predict phage–host interactions — another example of applying ML to biolo gical problems.
I also e njoy participating in machine learning comp etitions. For example, my team and I took part in the [location] x [compaany] Data Hack, where I fine-tuned ruRoberta for the classification of news articles. We also participated in the [compaany] PSB.Hack, where we deve loped a model for predicting booking cance llations using gradien t boosting. Most rece ntly, our team b ecame a finalist in a case championship on AI applications in clinical research, where I adapted Gemma 2 to extract and classify information about adverse drug reactions from user reviews.
For the past five months, I have been interni ng in the recomme nder systems group at [compaany] Lab. My research aims to improve the performa nce of sequen tia l recomme ndation models, such as transformer-based SASRec. In this context, my colleagues and I rece ntly completed a proj ect that leveraged large lan guage models to enhance recomme ndation quality; the results are at present being prepared for publication. In parallel, I am also invo lved in a project that appli es LLLMs to accura tely extract information from customer–operator dialogues, where I perform PEFT and eva luate the effe cti veness of various models.
Attending your summer schoo l represents an exciting opport unity to take the next step in my profes sional deve lopment. I am eager to learn from leading researchers, exchange ideas with other highly motivated students, and gain exposure to cutting-e dg e topics in modern machine learning. I am especially interested in exploring new directions in LLLM research — for example, I rece ntly studied LLaDA, a diffusion-based lan guage model that offers an al terna tive to tra ditional autoregres sive generation. I would be thrilled to learn more about such inn ovative app roaches and their future applications from the experts at your schoo l.
Beyond the academic content, I see the summer schoo l as a chance to become part of an interna tional community of passionate young researchers. I am particularly excited about the opport unity to visit [location] for the first time and experience its rich cu lture.
At this stage of my career, I am focused on gaining hands-on experience with real-wor ld proj ects, learning how large research teams operate, and developing a broader understanding of how ideas evolve from research to application. I am especially glad to be working in a research-o riented d epartment, as I hig hly value the creative and exploratory aspects of ML. In the longer term, I plan to r eturn to biomedical applications of machine learning, where I believe my interd isciplin ary bac kground can be most i mpactful. There are many important challenges in biology that could ben efit from ML solutions, yet there remai ns a significant gap between domain experts and machine learning prac tititioners. I hope to help bri dg e that gap by contributing to high-i mpact, cross-disciplinary research in the future.
Thank you very much for con sidering my application. I would be ho nored to participat e in your summer schoo l and continue developing as a machine learning researcher within such an inspiring envi ronment.
Sincerely,
[name]
