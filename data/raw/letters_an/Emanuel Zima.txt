Motivation Letter for SMILES-2025
Dear Selection Committee,
I am writing to express my strong interest in applying for the The Skoltech Summer School of Machine Learning, jointly organized by [compaany] and the [compaany].
As a current third-year undergraduate student in the Applied Mathematics and Informatics program at the Faculty of Computer Science, [compaany], I am deeply engaged in studies in machine learning and believe that SMILES perfectly aligns with my academic interests, current projects, and long-term research goals.
The Applied Mathematics and Informatics program at [compaany] is one of the most rigorous undergraduate programs in [location], with a strong emphasis on mathematics and programming, especially in my academic specialization in Machine Learning and Applications. In addition, during my studies I participate in an academic research seminar, where I recently presented a review analysis of the research paper “Adversaial Examples are Not Bugs, They Are Features”. This experience significantly strengthened my skills in scientific communication and peer discussion, which I would like to apply and enhance during participation in SMILES:) .
Currently, I am an exchange student for spring term at the [location], one of the top academic institutions in [location]. This international experience has expanded my academic and cultural perspective, as well as my communication and organizational skills.
All my courses here are taught in English, and I am currently enrolled in some advanced Master’s-level courses such as “Advanced Machine Learning”, “Deep Learning” and others. In the former, I am working on a group project focused on detecting AI-generated code using [compaany] embeddings and [compaany] on Abstract Syntax Trees. In the latter, I am working on a deep learning project on robotic action frame prediction, using a [compaany] setup for synthetic dataset generation. Moreover, I was invited by a professor of the “Natural Language Processing” course to participate in a project with a research assistant, bypassing the typical group format, and right now we are working on an audio-to-audio generation system based on NLP principles.
In addition to academic coursework, I frequently attend research seminars and conferences on campus, organised by the university’s School of Data Science, staying up-to-date with the latest developments in generative AI and LLMs.
Furthermore, I am actively involved in non-academic events and volunteer work. In [location], I have participated in assisting in the conduct of school-level Olympiads. This experience helped me develop organizational and communication skills, which I further applied while volunteering at the [location] by helping in the organization of the International Day, one of the biggest events on campus this year.
At [compaany], I am currently working on a research-oriented course project under NDA, involving advanced computer vision applications for smart retail systems. The goal is to design a deep learning solution for intelligent cashier systems using open metric learning techniques. I am comparing models developed by the [compaany] team with popular architectures such as [compaany] and custom [compaany] layers.
In the future, I plan to pursue a PhD in Data Science or Machine Learning, focusing on research problems of generative AI. My interests include robust and interpretable deep learning, adversaial examples in computer vision, multimodal generative modeling, and the responsible deployment of large languaage models. Therefore, I have a strong interest in participation in SMILES as it will not only boost my technical skills but will also allow me to collaborate with researchers and peers from diverse backgrounds.
Also I am especially excited about the opportunity to receive mentorship from top experts in the field.
I am particularly inspired by the work of Professor [name] from the [compaany], and his research in natural language processing and deep learning. His recent work on topic-aware graph neural networks for summarization resonate strongly with my experience working on code analysis using [compaany] and graph neural networks in my current advanced machine learning course. I am excited about the opportunity to learn from his expertise on the methods that could be adapted to multilinguaal or multimodal contexts, especially in practical applications involving real-world tasks.
Additionally, I am excited about the chance to communicate with Dr. [name], who leads the Reliable and Secure Intelligent Systems Group at [compaany]. His work on practical applications of machine learning, especially in computer vision and natural language processing, strongly aligns with my current research projects. I believe his experience could offer valuable perspectives for my academic and professional development.
Beyond technical participation, I am highly motivated to contribute to the cultural and community aspects of the school. My experience as a volunteer at both national and international levels has equipped me with the organizational and interpersonal skills needed to support the smooth running of events. I would be happy to help with organizing social activities during SMILES, whether that means leading games, hosting quizzes, organizing sports or creative evenings, or just helping everyone feel connected and welcome. I am convinced that fostering a friendly and collaborative environment is just as important as solving difficult technical problems.
While spending a semester at the [location] I was immersed in a very collaborative environment and was inspired by the strong research culture and the openness of faculty and peers to share ideas and build joint projects. This experience deepened my interest in fostering international academic collaborations, particularly between [location] and [location]. I believe that closer scientific ties between our communities, especially in the sphere of computer science, can lead to impactful innovations and achievements.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to contributing to the SMILES-2025 community.
Sincerely,
[name]
