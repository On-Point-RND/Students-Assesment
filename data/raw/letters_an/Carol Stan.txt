To whom it may concern,
I am writing to express my interest in the participation in the Summer of Machine Learning by [compaany]. I
graduaed from [university] with a Master’s degree in electronics and nanoelectronics, but now I realize that
I want to change my professional activity and study to become a DL Researcher.
I need SMILES to gain practical experience in advanced AI techniques, including generative models,
multimodal methods, large language models, multi-agent systems, which will be much more effective
compared to self-study, especially for such a wide range of topics. In addition, it is very important that you
have the opportunity to meet people from the industry and perhaps adjust your educational trajectory to get
closer to my goal (SMILES is one my last chances to get it). I think this is a great opportunity to dive a little
more in the industry, which I must take advaantage of. The schoo’s topics may be useful in my field of
interest, DL approaches in Materials Science - what I talked about in my presentation.
Also, I may be useful because I want to be a SMILES volunteer.
Thank you for considering my application.
Yours sincerely,
