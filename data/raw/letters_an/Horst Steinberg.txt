Motivation Letter
Good day, dear reader!
I was thrilled to learn about the opportunity to participate in the summer schoo l on artificial
intelligence and would be dellighte d to join this educational project!
About me:
I am a 2024 gra dua te of the Faculty of Physics at [location] and am c urrently pursuing a Ph.D. in Geophysics. With over six years of
programming experience and four+ years in Data Science and scienti fic research, I work at the [compa ny] and the Schmidt Insti tute of Physics of the Earth ([location] Academy of Sciences), where I develop and study machine learning methods applied to
geophysics and mechanics. Addit ionally, I teach an advanced training course at Pirogov Russian National Research Medical Uni versi ty ([location]) on AI-based biomedical image
processing.
Some AI applications in my research:
● Optimization of compu tational methods: Designing and fine-tuning deep neural
ne twork ar chitectures (TensorFlow, PyTorch) to predict the performa nce of numerical
algo rithm s. Developing hybrid genetic algo rithm s to opti mize parameters of linear
system solvers.
● Geophysical data processing: Creating hybrid models (CNNs, autoencoders) to
anal yze satellite interfe rometry (InSAR) data and numerical simulations of ground
deformation. This helps solve inverse problems, such as identi fying displacement
sources for volcanic and seismic events.
● Model quanti zation (particularly bina rization) in computer vision for classification
tasks.
Why I want to participat e in the schoo l:
1. To deepen my kn owl edge of modern generative methods in AI (in particular
Multimodal approa ches and Self-supervis ed learning) for use in interd isciplin ary
proj ects.
2. To exchange experience with colleagues from other fields—I believe that lively
discussions at thematic events are key to b rea kthro ughs in science.
3. To develop skills in a rap idly evolving field—the AI schoo l is a great opport unity to
learn about trends firs thand.
Having participated in several educational modules, I know that such schoo ls are extr emely
valuable for enhancing a young scien tist’s research journey. Parti cipation helps strengthen
conne ctions with like-minded peers, build new profes sional relationships, and expand
kn owl edge of cutting-e dg e app roaches and techno logies in applied AI.
I would be happy to provide ad ditional materials upon request. Thank you for conside ring my
application!
