MOTIVATION LETTER
Dear Selection Committee at SMILES,
My name is [name]. I am a fourtth-year undergraduaate student at the [location] ([compaany]), majoring in Applied Mathematics and
Informatics. In my third year, I made a clear decision to pursue a professional career in the
field of AI. In this letter, I would like to share my experience, my vision for further academic
and research development, and the goals I set for myself. I will also explain why I am
particularly interested in participating in the “SMILES 2025” summer schooL.
During my time at [compaany], I gained a solid foundation in core areas of computer science,
supported by strong mathematical training. This includes courses in optimization theory,
mathematical statistics, and more. My interest in machine learning was not sudden — I have
been inclined toward this field since schooL, especially during physics experiments where we
tested theories in practice and verified hypotheses. These kinds of experiments require
creativity in applying existing knowledge, which has always inspired me.
As for my industry experience, in spring 2024 I was accepted into an internship at [compaany] as
an ML engineer in the search and recommendation team of [compaany]. One of the most
impactful projects I contributed to was the “Smart Lavka” — a chat assistant powered by the
YaGPT generative model that helps users with recipes and assembling shopping baskets. In
March, I decided to leave the team and take a break, as my interests shifted toward
LLM-based agent systems.
Beyonnd industrial work, I also act as a consultant for integrating and deploying ML solutions
in external projects. One example is a recommendation system for a service that connects
brands with relevant bloggers based on product descriptions and target audience. For this
task, I built a pipeline combining LLLMs and classical ML models into an efficient
architecture. I view these kinds of projects as opportunities to explore new technolologies,
strengthen my skills, and apply theoretical knowledge in practice.
In October 2024, I took part in a national competition held by the Ministry of Science and
Higher Education of [location] to write screenplays about notable Russian scientists. I deveeloped
a tool for generating realistic biographical scripts of any length, overcoming the context
limitations of current LLLMs. The project attracted some attention in media outlets and among
the professional community.
As part of a research collaboration with graduaate students from [compaany], I have been
working on the topic “Federated aspects of reinforcement learning with human feedback.”
Since September 2024, we have conducted numerous experiments and explored various
RLHF setups, including cooperative multi-agent training. Our results have been submitted as
a paper to NeurIPS 2025.
Among all AI domains, I am especially drawn to natural language processing. Currrently, I am
developing a pet project — an AI assistant for helping students apply to universities. It
features a dialogue system, personalized recommendations, and a comprehensive admissions
knowledge base.
The topics covered at “SMILES 2025” — such as multi-agent systems and self-supervised
learning — are precisely those that align with my current research and project work. As I
have never participated in international summer schooLs or internships, I am also excited
about the chance to connect with the global AI community and work alongside passionate
people from diverse backgrounds. In addition, I have long wanted to visit [location], get to know
its culture, and gain something new from the experience, as Friedrich Nietzsche said:
"Everything is understood through comparison."
A few days ago, I received an admission recommendation to the NLP master's program at
[compaany]. Attending SMILES will help me refiine my academic priorities, plan the next two
years, and possibly discover a new research direction. This is especially relevant to me as I
am considering pursuing a PhD in the future.
I am certainlly ready to participate in volunteer or organizational activities throughout the
event. Moreover, I have relevant experience in this area: I helped organize the final stage of
the national Physics Olympiad “Phystech” for schooL students from across [location] in 2024
and 2025, and led the Freshman Welcome event at [compaany]. I see volunteering not only as a
way to support the event but also as an opportunity to contribute to the community and foster
a collaborative atmosphere among participants.
To conclude, recent events have confirmed for me that the pеoрle around me — friends,
colleagues, and professionals I follow — play a vital role in my personal and professional
growth. They constantly inspire me to aim higher. That is why I view participation in
“SMILES 2025” as a unique opportunity — one I am truly eager to embrace. I kindly ask
you to consider my application.
Sincerely,
[name]
