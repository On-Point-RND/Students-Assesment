Motivation letter
My journey into robotics has been—and remains—thorny, and I still cannot call it easy. Yet this has not deterred me from pursuing the field relentlessly. When someone admits they dislike their work, we naturally sympathize and hope they find their true calling. We sympathize with them and hope they will find their field of activity soon. If the answer is yes, we are happy for them, because they have found joy and the opportunity to grow within their profession, perhaps as robotics specialists. Such people often become excellent specialists and even heads of departments—exactly the kind of people governments need: smart, reliable, and perhaps a little talented. However, I do not belong to any of these categories. I have a special relationship with robotics—it is unique. If others can change their field of activity due to circumstances, I cannot. For me, robotics is not just a way of earning money or a fashionable field of activity; it is an important part of my life, and to lose it would mean losing myself. My emotions when researching this area vary, and I am not always happy with the results. Nevertheless, these sincere emotions are a part of me that I must accept to continue developing and living. I am the guy who said he was going to become a roboticist, and he did.
My strategy was simple: to develop and outline a plan for completing the task of becoming a first-class specialist researcher who would not face unsolvable problems, but only those that could be addressed within a limited time using a clear work plan. Of course, no matter how deeply we delve into any area, it will always turn out to be insufficient to fully describe the world. However, at a certain stage, it can be stated that a specialist’s knowledge will suffice both to solve typical tasks and to dare to start solving something new. This is the level where I feel comfortable in mechanics, electronics, and programming. However, modern tools are constantly emerging, and it is thanks to them that old tasks can be solved better and faster. ML is one of these tools. No matter how old-fashioned my views on research approaches may seem, I have concluded that it is simply foolish not to utilize such a powerful modern tool; this is a significant omission that would prevent overcoming the most challenging stage in problem-solving: initializing primary information and formulating the correct desired answer. Therefore, I became interested in discovering new ML approaches. In particular, I am interested in multimodal approaches, because, as practice shows, most problems arise from low-quality training data. As a result, the model undergoes technical training, but ultimately learns to do something different from what we expected, or its training results do not align with the mechanics of the real world. However, one way to improve the quality and informativeness of the data is to use different methods to describe the same actions in the world from varied perspectives.
It would be very interesting for me to study such approaches within the summer school as well as expand my limited knowledge in principle. I have used various tools at the application level, but I have always wanted not just to use models for data modification, but also to understand the intricacies of architecture and solve the local problem of combining different modalities through a well-written encoder.
In the robotics laboratory, I started and partially continue to work on maintaining the operability of testing stands for robotic models. My broad understanding of robotics allows me to trace cause-and-effect relationships and identify problems at the data level. The only missing piece to fully grasp the entire picture is awareness of ML model architecture principles, which would enable direct investigation of how sensory perception parameters (e.g., manipulator joint position changes or RGBD data from visual sensors) affect final learning quality metrics. It is this question that I intend to dedicate my dissertation to and, after defending it, I will likely pursue a scientific career. I see how understanding the essence of robotic data could simplify model training. Instead of collecting data without adhering to the principles of isolated experimentation, one could collect it by freezing all known parameters and then incrementally "thawing" them to record the effect of each parameter on the final result. However, most of the work on manipulative robotics models neither describes the essence of their data nor interprets their results clearly, which hinders progress toward AGI-level robotic manipulation. I am convinced that the knowledge I gain at the summer school will help bridge this gap.
