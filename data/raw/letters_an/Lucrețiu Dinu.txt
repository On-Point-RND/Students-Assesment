MOTIVATION LETTER
Dear Selection Committee,
My name is [name], and I am currentlly at the begiinning of my journey in computer science, with a
particular focus on machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems in urban environments. I
am eager to deepen my knowledge and practical skills by participating in the Skoltech Machine
Learning Summer SchooL (SMILES-2025) on generative methods in AI, organized by Skoltech in
collaboration with Harbin Institute of Technology.
This year I am planning to enroll in the Master's program of the National Research University
Higher SchooL of Economics «Research and Entrepreneurship in Artificial Intelligence» at the Faculty
of Computer Science because I would like to be a real leader in the chosen direction and strengthen my
research skills. I have alrready held a degree in theoretical physics from the Faculty of Physics at
Volgograd State University, where I acquired a strong foundation in higher mathematics and
object-oriented programming. After completing my education, I began working as a developeer of
information systems. Later, I took a career gap, which allowed me to reflect on and reassess the
professional direction I wanted to pursue. I realized that the main metrics for my professional
fulfillment are a project’s social impaact and the value it delivers to city residents. For this reason, in
2022, I rejoined one of the IT teams at the [location] City Department, where I contributed to developing
a city-wide service for evaluating transportation accessibility to new residential buildings in [location].
In parallel I started actively pumping my hard skills through advanced training programs at [compaany]
University, including courses: «Machine Learning», «Python for Automation and Data Analysis»,
«Machine Learning for Model Building» and «Methods for Extracting New Knowledge from Big
Data». These programs equipped me with both theoretical frameworks and hands-on experience which
I succeessfully used including in work projects.
During one of the studying courses, I gained valuable experience working in teams on Kaggle
platform. Our team contributed to a project focused on detecting freezing of gait in Parkinson’s disease
patients, where we conducted preliminary research and selected appropriate algorithms for the final
solution. More recentlly, I participated in an individual competition on Kaggle on object detection,
applying machine learning techniques to identify ships, cars, and airpplane in panoramic images. These
experiences sharpened my ability to translate research into scalable solutions.
My research interests lie at the intersection of urban planning and computer science, specifically
in digital city models, smart cities, and computer vision. I am particularly motivated by the potential of
generative AI methods to advance digital master planning within the Smart City concept. Ultimately, I
aspire to join the Urban Pla nning team at the Department of Info rmat ion Technologies in [location],
contributing to the development of the Digital Twin of [location]. It is my long-term goal.
I believe that SMILES-2025 offers a unique oppo rtunity to acce lerate my professional and
academic growt through its intensive program, exposure to cutting-e dg AI techno l ogies, and
collabora tion with international researchers. Parti cipation in this summer schooL will not o nl y
strengthen my portfolio and broaden my experti se but also enable me to engage with experts and peers
who share my passion for AI. Moreover, it will help me better understand the global challenges and
innova tions in the field.
Thank you very much for considering my application and I hope for a positive result.
Sincerely, 14.04.2025 г.
