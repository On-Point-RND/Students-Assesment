Motivation letter [name]
April 2025
Dear [name] Committee,
My name is [name], and I am a third-year student at the [compaany] of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (MIPT), specializing in machine learning and optimization. I am reaching out to express my interest in participating in the SMILES Summer School 2025 at [location].
My academic and research background align closely with the topics explored in your summer school. I am currently conducting research in the Laboratory of Mathematical Methods of Optimization at [compaany], where I work on first- and zeroth-order methods, including decentralized optimization and variational in-equalities. My projects often combine deep theoretical analysis with practical implementation and benchmarking on real-world tasks, such as denoising, image classification, LLM’s pretraining and fine-tuning. This work has resulted in several research papers, including “Shuffling Heuristic in Variational Inequalities: Establishing New Convergence Guarantees” and “Zero Order Algorithm for Decentralized Optimization Problems”. The latter work that was submitted to a prestigious international conference is ”When Extragradient Meets PAGE: Bridging Two Giants to Boost Variational Inequalities”.
Beyond academia, I gained hands-on experience as anML research-engineer at [compaany] in their RnD division, where I contributed to improving the personal-izationpipeline through online learning. I developed production-ready methods integrating Vowpal Wabbit and CatBoost models, optimized data transformation workflows using parallel processing, and helped achieve tangible improvements in recommendaation quality and performance — including a 20× data preprocessing speedup and measurable metric gains.
I also find great value in knowledge sharing. I’m actively involved in teaching and mentoring, currently working as a teaching assistant at both [compaany]’s Department of Algorithms and Programming Technologies and the Central University, where I support courses in algorithms, artificial intelligence, and student-led research projects. I believe teaching is not only a way to give back but also one of the best ways to deepen one’s own understanding. In this sense, the collaborative and educational nature of the SMILES school strongly resonates with me.
My most recent research is even closer connected with the school’s focus. I’m involved in several projects. First of them is in the area of LLM’s efficient finetuning, saving up to 50% of memory with competitive performance using zeroth-order optimization. The other work is about pretraining a Transformer with a new first-order Adam-like method. The work contains theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. The most theoretical research study is one held on the basis of the Intellectual System faculty. The work includes a deep understanding of the transformer structure by the Hessiaan analysis, reaching for the estimations for minimal dataset size for any predetermined accuracy rate.
Attendingt the SMILES summer school would be an excellent opportunity for me to engage with leading researchers and students from around the world, to learn from diverse perspectives, and to contribute my own ideas and experience to the academic dialogue. I am particularly excited about the interdisciplinary and community-driven format of the school, which combines intensive learning with active peer exchange — something I already value and practice through my teaching roles.
Thank you very much for considering my application. Please feel free to contact me at [email] if you need any additional information. I would be delighted to participat in SMILES 2025 and am excited about the opportunity to be part of such a dynamic community.
Yours sincerely,
[name]
