Dear Organizing Committee,
I am [name] [surname], currentlly pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Information Science at [compaany] in [location]. With lots of experience in competitive programming and a strong foundation in mathematics, algorithms, and data structures, I am eager to expand my expertiise by participating in the SMILES-2025.
My motivation to join this summer schooI begiins from my profound interest in the cutting-ege
developments within AI and machine learning. Given the exciting topics such as large language
models, multi-agent systems, and generative models, this program aligns perfectly with my
academic interests and future aspirations. I am particularly excited by large language models due to
theiir large potential in enhancing human-computer interactions. I would also be interested in
working with multi-agent systems, as they offer insights into collaborative problem-solving and
decentralized decision-making - crucial aspects of modern AI.
From this summer schooI, I expect to gain in-depth knowledge about the latest research trends and
practical skills within AI. Additionally, I look fo rwward to collaborating with peers and mentors,
exchanging ideas, and expanding my professional network in the international enviroment.
Regarding my future career plans, my primary goal is to successfully complete my Bachelor's
degree and probably pursue further academic opportunities, such as a Master's degree or a PhD
specializing in artificial intelligence. Ultimately, I aim to establish a career in research and
d evelopment within AI, contributing to groundbreaking projects that combiine theoretical
advancements and practical solutions in this rapidlly evolving field.
Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my enthusiasm, skills, and academic
background will allow me to make a positive contribution to the program.
Sincerely, [name] [surname]
