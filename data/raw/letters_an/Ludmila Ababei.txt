Dear Committee,
My name is [name] [surname] and I am an ambitious ML researcher in the field of chemistry. At the moment I am a 4th year undergraduate student of the Chemistry Department of [location] [university]. Since studying in school I wanted to combine my interests in computer science and chemistry, so when I got to university I joined the Group of Theoretical Chemistry № 24 at [company], where I engaged in quantum chemical modeling of reaction mechanisms. During that work, I have successfully completed several projects, one of them we we have had published in Q1 journal ”Organic & Biomolecular Chemistry”. In addition to the reaction modeling projects, I also worked on devising a new conformational search approach based on Bayesian Optimization and Gaussian Process Regression model. This work required foundational machine learning knowledge, which inspired me to pursue deeper study of ML principles. Beyond my group research, I independently expanded my expertise in machine and deep learning through specialized courses and targeted internships.
After the second year of study at the university, I secured an internship at [company]. For 4 month I was working in the [company] Translate team, where I were improving quality of translation models via active learning. This experience significantly advanced my practical and theoretical skills in deep learning.
Now, with some experience and knowledge in the field of machine learning, I am applying it to the chemistry in the several projects dealing with the modern ML techniques such as LLM,GraphNeuralNetworks, MetricLearning, Bayesianapproaches. One particularly challenging initiative focuses on generating polymers with target properties- a problem complicated by the scarcity of known polymer structures (10000 times fewer than pharmaceutical compounds, where this task is also important), which limits conventional tools. Furthermore, I employ Bayesian approaches to overcome data scarcity challenges in scientific research. Providing the ability to estimate the prediction uncertainty, these models become much more reliable. So, I successfully applied Gaussian Process Regression for the prediction of polymer composite materials properties and built the Bayesian model for sensor calibration, which diminished the number of required experimental iterations by about the 3 times while maintaining target accuracy.
I am deeply convinced that machine learning approaches could push the frontiers of chemical science, especially as digital data in this field has grown exponentially in recent years. This growth enables modern methods that have transformed data-rich domains like NLP. Especially LLMs seems to be the one instrument, that could change the way a chemist works as a scientist. So, when I heard about SMILES 2025 summer school, I immediately recognized its alignment with my goals and I am really interested interested in participating. The curriculum’s focus on multimodal/generative AI and self-supervised learning directly applies to both chemistry and broader scientific challenges. Fascinating speaker lineup promises invaluable insights, and I am confident participation will advance my ML and statistics expertise, directly benefiting my research. Moreover, I have no doubt, that fruitful dialogues during the school will inspire me and maybe other participants to the new projects.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
