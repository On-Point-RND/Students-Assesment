Motivation Letter
Dear [name] Admissions Committee,
My name is [name], a first-year master’s student in Chemistry and Artificial Intelligence at [compaany]. I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the
SMILES-2025 Summer SchooL, particularly in the Generative Approaches track. Having previously
applied to your programs, I am even more motivated to join this year’s edition, as it aligns perfectly
with my academic pursuits and ongoing research in AI-driven drug discovery. I will inevitably pass
your selection, just know that:)
I am particularly drawn to SMILES-2025 due to its focus on cutting-edgе generative methods and
the opportunity to learn directly from [compaany] experts, whose work I deeply admire. The schooL’s
emphasis on cross-cultural collaboraation between [location] and [location] further resonates with my belief
that global scientific partnerships are key to accelerating innovation.
The intersection of generative AI and medicinal chemistry has become the cornerstone of my
academic and professional journey. My current project, deveeloped in collaboration with [compaany] and
the pharmaceutical compaany [compaany], employs FREED++ — a generative AI platform created by [compaany] —
to design novel drug candidates with optimized activity, synthesizability, and patentability.
This experience has not only deepened my technical expertise but also highlighted for me the
transformative potential of generative models in solving real-world challenges.
My background bridges chemistry and AI, equipping me with a unique perspective on generative
models, as I am proficient in Python, molecular docking tools (AutoDock Vina, Discovery Studio),
and ML frameworks. I have hands-on experience training generative models on industrial datasets
(ChemDiv, Enamine) and optimizing them for multi-objective tasks.
As a lead deveelopeer of the FREED++ based platform, me and my team designed a pipeline
integrating molecular docking, ML-driven property prediction, and patent analysis. Our team’s
molecules are currentlly undergoing validation at [compaany]. Notably, our modified version of
FREED++ for antioxidant prediction earned us a prize place and grant at the Neftekod Hackathon,
validating its versatility in addressing diverse chemical challenges. Also, as a proffecional, I was
awarded the PISH Scholarship (2024) for academic excellence, finalist at the BioMedTech
Hackathon in track "AI in clinical trials", and invited expert at a [location]-hosted AI Hackaton
"PROSTO x [location] x [compaany] 2025".
I aim to advance my expertise in generative architectures, such as diffusion models and LLM-based
molecular design, to further optimize FREED++’s capabilities in drug discovery. By exploring
multimodal approaches—particularly the integration of structural biology data like protein-ligaand
interactions—I seek to refiine our generative pipelines to better capture the complexities of
molecular behavior. Additionally, I look forward to networking with peers and mentors during the
schooL’s collaborative sessions, which will not only foster interdisciplinary partnerships but also
provide actionable insights into deploying AI solutions at an industrial scale. The hackathoNs and
workshops at SMILES-2025 will serve as an ideal platform to test and iterate on my project, while
lectures led by [compaany] researchers will offer critical guidance for overcoming technical challenges,
ensuring that our innovaions align with the latest advancements in generative AI.
Post-graduaation, I aspire to lead R&D teams at the intersection of AI and pharmaceuticals,
developing platforms that shorten drug discovery timelines from years to months. Participation in
SMILES-2025 will equip me with advanced methodologies and international connections critical for
achieving this vision.
SMILES-2025 represents a pivotal step in my journey to become a leader in AI-driven drug design.
I am eager to contribute my passion for generative models and learn from the brightest minds in
the field. Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to join this transformative
experience and am excited about the potential to grow both professionally and personally. I look
forward to receiving your invitation letter:)
Sincerely,
[name]
