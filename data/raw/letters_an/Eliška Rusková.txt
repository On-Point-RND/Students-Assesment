I would really love to take part in the SMILES Summer School, as it would be a great opportunity for me to deepen and structure the knowledge I've already gained, while also discovering new ideas and approaches in AI. I'm especially excited about the chance to learn from [compaany] researchers and work alongside peers who are equally passionate about machine learning and its real-world applications.
My background lies in geospatial data processing and mapping systems. At [compaany], I've worked on integrating advanced computer vision models - including 3D segmentation and object detection - into production pipelines, using PyTorch and large-scale data engineering tools such as Spark, Hive, and Airflow. This experience taught me to bridge low-level engineering with high-level ML model development, and to think carefully about both architecture and performance.
Recently, I've become increasingly interested in reinforcement learning, large language models, and generative AI - especially their intersection with spatial data. I'm fascinated by the idea of building intelligent agents that can navigate, describe, and interpret complex environments. My long-term goal is to create systems that combine deep learning with reasoning over real-world structures - and SMILES feels like the perfect environment to sharpen my ideas and explore new directions.
I believe I could contribute to the school with both hands-on engineering experience and a deep curiosity for research. I'm excited about the practical sessions, teamwork, and mentorship opportunities, and would be truly grateful to be part of the SMILES community.
