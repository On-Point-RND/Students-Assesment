Dear organizers,
My name is [name], I’m finiishing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [location] [compaany] this year. I’m thinking right now about what I want to do next.
I plan to start working in a company, gain practical experience, and keep growing as a professional.
But more than just getting a job, I’ve always had a bigger dream — to create something meaningful. I want to build something that helps people in real life. Something useful and thoughtful. And at the same time, I want it to be something I truly love — something that inspires me because it’s created by me, with my own knowledge, effort, and ideas. That’s my main goal in life. To get there, I want to keep learning and exploring. I believe that machine learning and data science are some of the most powerful tools today. They allow us to solve real-world problems, make smart decisions, and build technologies that actually make a difference. That’s why I’m applying to the SMILES Summer School, I see it as a great chance to learn more, meet interesting people, and take one more step towards my dream. During my studies, I’ve already tried a lot of things in this field. I learned Python and SQL: some on my own, some through courses and university. I worked on a project where we used mathematical modeling and optimization to improve dairy production processes. I also joined different schools and case championships in analytics and data science ([location] & [location] Spring School, a [location] case competition, and more). I’ve always been curious and motivated to understand how data works and how it can help in real situations. But even with this background, I know there is still so much to learn. The idea that I can always go deeper, discover something new, and become better step by step really excites me.
I like being in communities where people share knowledge and support each other. I enjoy discussions, group work, and the feeling that we’re building something together. I think SMILES can give me exactly that kind of experience.
What I expect from this summer school is not only practical tasks and lectures, but also inspiration. I want to meet people who also care about meaningful work, exchange ideas, and hear about their journeys. I want to learn how others use ML in research and projects, and how they think about the problems they solve. For me, that’s just as important as technical knowledge.
In the near future, I want to continue my education and apply for a Master’s program in data science. I’m interested in the intersection of AI, technology, and human needs, how we can create systems that support people. I would love to work on projects that improve lives and make the world a little bit better. I know that path won’t always be easy, it will take time, effort, and constant learning. But I’m ready for it. I really hope that being part of the SMILES Summer School will help me grow, also as a person who wants to create with meaning and heart.
Thank you for reading my letter. I would be really happy to join the SMILES School this year and start this new step in my journey.
Best regards,
