Motivation Letter for SMILES-2025
Ever since I began my studies at [location] and discovered the world of deep learning,
I’ve been captivated by the applications of 2D computer vision and its intersection with the
physical world through various sensors and 3D geometry. My journey began with research
(which later led to a thesis) in 3D reconstruction, where I first encountered the power of
combining data-driven models with spatial understanding. This experience was very
important: it opened my eyes to the potential of learning from visual data and inspired me to
seek out every opportunity to further explore computer vision, sensor integration, and
geometric learning.
From that point forward, I deliberately searched for research and professional projects
that allowed me to work with 3D geometry, classic computer vision, or sensory data. I’ve
always been fascinated by how machines can perceive and understand the world around them
— especially when combining multiple modalities. And the more I surrounded myself with
people who shared this interest, the more inspired I became. Being part of such a community,
exchanging ideas, and imagining the kinds of solutions we can create together — these
experiences constantly fuel my desire to grow and innovate in this field.
Currently, I work at [company], a company developing driver monitoring systems (DMS)
based on in-cabin infrared cameras. My role involves working at the intersection of sensors,
perception algorithms, and real-time applications. This hands-on experience with real-world
computer vision systems has deepened my appreciation for the challenges and importance of
robust perception in safety-critical environments. As [company] began expanding into
autonomous driving technologies, I find myself eager to transition into this direction as well.
In particular, I am deeply interested in how multimodal learning can be applied to the
challenges of autonomous driving. Fusing different types of data — images, LIDAR, radar,
GPS, even audio — holds enormous promise in making autonomous systems safer and more
context-aware. I see SMILES-2025 as an opportunity to not only dive deeper into multimodal
approaches but also learn about other cutting-edge ideas, such as generative models in the
context of autonomous systems (e.g. to synthesize useful training datasets). I want to
understand how such models can improve perception, planning, or simulation capabilities for
self-driving cars.
Beyond learning, I’m also excited about the community aspect of the school. I believe
that some of the best learning comes from discussions with others — hearing how different
people approach the same problem, what assumptions they challenge, and what ideas they
bring from their own experience. I hope to meet new colleagues and collaborators who can
challenge my thinking, inspire new projects, and perhaps even shape the direction of my
future research.
At the same time, I’m committed to becoming a better professional and sharing my
knowledge with others. As a teaching assistant for a video processing and computer vision
course in AI Masters, I lead seminars for students just starting their journey into this field.
Teaching helps me stay up to date with the latest architectures and ideas, and keeps me
grounded in the fundamentals. It’s important to me to remain in touch with the broader
trends in deep learning, and I believe SMILES-2025 will help me gain deeper insights into
current methods and challenges — especially those that go beyond traditional vision tasks
and involve the rich complexity of multimodal learning.
Ultimately, I see participation in this school as a step forward — not just in my career,
but in my ability to contribute meaningfully to a field that I truly care about. I want to create
things that help others, that can be used in the real world, and that push the boundaries of
what we believe is possible with machine perception. I hope this school will be a place where I
can grow, exchange ideas, and continue building that future — together with others who are
just as passionate about it as I am.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
