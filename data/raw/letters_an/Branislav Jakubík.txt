Dear Organizers,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am a first-year student at the [compaany]. I view participation in your Machine Learning and Deep Learning School in [location] as a unique opportunity not only to enhance my technical expertise but also to prepare for further international studies.
My passion for artificial intelligence originates from practical projects. In 2023, I developed an autonomous robot capable of recognizing hand gestures using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and 3D printing during the All-Russian Student Research Competition, for which I was awarded a Third-Degree Diploma. Additionally, I completed a course at the [compaany] Engineering School, where I studied autonomous control systems—an experience that significantly deepened my proficiency in applying machine learning to robotics.
I combine an active lifestyle with a strong technical mindset; engaging in sports fosters discipline and perseverance, while studying foreign languages broadens my perspective.
My diligence and analytical inclination drive my continuous personal and professional development.
International growth is a central aspect of my ambitions. Over the past year, I have been diligently studying the [language], as my goal is to pursue a master’s degree at [location], a renowned institution offering specialized programs in AI-driven robotics. With [location] firmly established as a world leader in robotics and artificial intelligence, I am confident that the experience gained through your program will greatly strengthen my profile and support my future academic endeavors abroad.
In addition to my technical background, my teaching experience at [compaany]—where I design and deliver mathematics lessons—has refined my skills in communication, teamwork, and simplifying complex ideas. I believe these qualities are indispensable for collaborative projects and international exchange in your program.
I am convinced that the combination of my hands-on experience, academic achievements, and well-defined career goals aligns with the objectives of your school. Participation in your program will enable me to broaden my expertise, establish valuable international connections, and make a meaningful contribution to the development of innovative technologies at the intersection of machine learning and robotics.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from your distinguished program.
