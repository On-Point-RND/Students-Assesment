Motivation Letter for [name]
Dear Selection Committee,
My name is [name], a first‑year master’s student in Applied Mathematics and
Information Science at [university] and a Machine Learning Engineer at [company]
in [location]. I am writing to express my strong interest in attending SMILES‑2025. The
schoo’s unique mission—uniting Russian and Chinese early‑career researchers to advance
modern machine learning through innovative research and real‑world applications—perfectly
aligns with my academic trajec­tory, profes­sional work, and long‑term career aspirations.
Motivation
I view SMILES‑2025 as an exceptional opportu­nity to accelerate my transition from
indus­try‑focused ML engineering to academi­cally‑o­riented, im­pact‑driven AI research.
Working on production‑grade models in banking and computer‑vision start‑ups has provided
me with practical insights into scaling ML systems, but it has also highlighted the urge­ncy of
rigorous research into model robus­tness, fair­ness, and interpretability—topics stro­ngly
repres­ented in the SMILES cur­ricu­lum. Immersi­ng myself in an inter­national cohort will
expose me to diverse research questions and inspire colla­borations that transcend borders.
Experience with ML and DL Tools
Indus­try projects. At [company] I built and deployed two core microservices: an o­nline
Risk Scoring Model and a Probability of Default Model for mid‑sized and large corporate
clients. Both services are con­tainerized with Docker, orchestrated via Kubernetes, and
inte­grated into the bank’s credit‑de­cision pipeline as REST APIs, ensuring millisec­ond‑level
late­ncy and bank‑grade reliability. I also pro­totyped an LLM‑powered microservice that
parse­s real‑time news streams to generate in­dus­try ov­erviews, broaden­ing my familiarity with
transformer ar­chi­tec­tures and prompt engineering.
Earlier, at [company], I delivered proof‑of‑concept solutions on a wo­rld‑class face‑recognition
pla­tform. I adapted convolutio­nal‑net­work ensembles to new domains, o­ptimized inference
on edge devices, and implemented addit­ional API func­tion­ality in Python and Bash
citetuurn0file0.
Research‑style projects. To strengthen my theor­etical foun­da­tion I completed several
Kar­pov Courses (StartML, HardML) and built open‑sou­rce projects such as SmartEye, a
FastAPI face‑recognition service, and Pimp My DS, a Telegram bot that leverages LLMs to
re­com­mend data‑science content. My C/C++ background allowed me to implement custom
data structures (vector, map) and mathe­matical libraries, deepen­ing my apprec­i­ation for
efficient memory‑safe code.
Collec­tively, these experiences have honed my pro­fi­cie­ncy with Python, PyTorch, Docker,
Kubernetes, SQL, and Aiirflow; yet they have also shown me the limits of self‑study and the
value of formal research mentorship.
Expecta­tions from SMILES‑2025
1. Advanced theory workshops. I seek rigorous exposure to cutting‑e­dg­e topics such
as self‑supervis­ed repre­sentation learning, diffusion models, and federated
learning—areas dir­ectly rel­evant to pri­va­cy‑sen­sitive financial data and cross‑border
colla­borations.
2. Research mentorship. Interacting with leading facul­ty from Russian and Chinese
uni­versities will help re­fine my exis­ting research idea: employ­ing domain‑adaptive
foun­da­tion models to improve credit‑risk estimates under distri­bu­tion shift.
3. Cross‑cu­ltural exchange. Sharing perspectives with Chinese peers working on
large‑scale indus­trial AI systems will broaden my under­stand­ing of deplo­yment
con­straints and data‑gov­er­nance frameworks ou­tside of Europe.
4. Publication pipeline insight. Hands‑on ses­sions in writ­ing and re­viewing will
demystify the submis­sion process to top venues—a skill set I am eager to cul­ti­vate
while pre­par­ing my first conference paper.
Career Plans
My long‑term goal is to become a research‑driven ML engineer who bri­dges academia and
indus­try. In the next two years I plan to:
● Publish at least one peer‑re­viewed paper on ex­plai­nable credit‑risk modeling under
covar­iate shift.
● Contribute to open‑sou­rce libraries that facili­tate the deplo­yment of trustwo­rthy AI in
regu­lated sectors.
● Pursue a PhD joint­ly su­pervised by [university] and an inter­national par­tner,
fo­cus­ing on proba­bilis­tic deep learning for financial decision‑making.
Parti­cipation in SMILES‑2025 will be pivotal to these goals: it will equip me with advanced
metho­do­lo­gical tools, introduce me to prospec­tive colla­borators, and provide a pla­tform to
val­i­date my research ideas through poster ses­sions and fee­dback from sen­ior scien­tists.
Conclusion
With a solid foun­da­tion in deplo­ying ML systems at scale and a grow­ing appe­tite for rigorous
research, I am confident that I will both ben­e­fit from and mean­ing­fully con­tribute to
SMILES‑2025. I bring hands‑on ex­perti­se in financial and computer‑vision applications, a
track record of rapid pro­to­typing, and a pas­sion for knowl­edge sharing—as evidenced by my
open‑sou­rce projects and mentorship of junior colleagues. I am eager to ex­change ideas,
tackle chal­len­ging prob­lems, and help foster the colla­bo­ra­tive spirit that makes
SMILES‑2025 a cat­alyst for in­no­va­tion in the AI community.
Thank you for con­sid­er­ing my ap­pli­ca­tion. I look fo­rward to the pos­sib­il­ity of con­tribu­ting to
and learn­ing from this vibrant inter­disci­plin­ary gat­hering.
Sincerely,
[name]
