Dear Members of the Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my enthusiastic application to the Skoltech Summer
School of Machine Learning (SMILES‑2025). As a second‑year student in Applied
Mathematics and Informatics at [institution], I have cultivated a deep appreciation for the interplay between abstract
theory and practical computation. It is this dual passion—rooted in my earliest
explorations of physical models and blossoming through hands‑on machine
learning—that drives my desire to join your program.
From childhood afternoons spent sketching pendulums and projectile trajectories
to winning prizes in the All‑Russian School Olympiad in Physics and medals at the
IEPhO, I have always been drawn to the art of modeling. Yet it was only in tenth
grade, when a friend and I wrote our first ML scripts to compete in weekend
hackathons. The realization that machine learning could tackle large‑scale,
real‑world problems with intricate models—accelerating insights that once took
days of manual calculation—sparked a drive to pursue ML and DA at a deeper
level.
At [institution], I am currently building a strong mathematical foundation—grounded in
linear algebra, probability theory, and numerical methods—while taking
dedicated courses in machine learning that equip me with both theoretical
insights and hands-on skills to approach complex problems. Under the guidance
of the General Physics Department, I am conducting research that explores the
connection between spin glass models from statistical mechanics and the
learning dynamics of neural networks. Spin glasses, with their disordered
interactions and rugged energy landscapes, offer a compelling analogy to the
non-convex loss surfaces encountered in deep learning.
In this project, I study a multilayer Sherrington–Kirkpatrick (MSK) model,
employing Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations and the Parisi ansatz to analyze
energy minimization and phase transitions. By solving the Thouless–Anderson–
Palmer (TAP) equations, I identify critical freezing points and investigate how
emergent structures in disordered systems relate to convergence behaviors in
neural networks. This work was presented at [institution]’s 67th All-Russian Scientific
Conference, where it was awarded first place—highlighting the potential of
statistical physics methods to provide meaningful insights into the behavior of
modern machine learning systems.
While this project has deepened my theoretical understanding, I am also working
to apply these ideas in practice. As an early ML contributor at [company], a startup
marketplace for new housing, I am helping to integrate transformer-based NER
models to parse complex user queries and employed lightweight LLM agents to
auto-generate property descriptions. Additionally, I am leading a team of
developers in designing and implementing a semantic search system with L1-
based ranking. This ongoing project allows me to bridge theory and real-world
deployment, while deepening my experience in building scalable, intelligent
systems.
I am drawn to SMILES‑2025 because it offers something that is often missing in
fast-paced ML environments — the space to think deeply. The school brings
together areas I am genuinely curious about, from language models to generative
methods, not just as technologies, but as ideas that challenge our understanding
of learning itself. I don’t approach machine learning as a toolbox, but rather as a
field where structure, dynamics, and interpretation matter — much like in physics.
What I value most is the opportunity to learn from people who combine strong
theoretical thinking with real engineering experience. I hope to better understand
the design principles behind modern architectures and how we reason about their
behavior. I am especially drawn to the research and development side of machine
learning, where exploration, analysis, and implementation come together.
SMILES‑2025 feels like the right place to ask meaningful questions, explore
connections, and gain perspective on where the field is heading — and where I
might fit into it.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
Rodion [surname]
