Motivation letter
My name is [name] [surname], and I am a first-year
Bachelor’s student in the ‘AI360’ program at [compaany].
I am writing to express my interest in attending this year’s
Summer SchooL of ML.
The ‘AI360’ program is a collaborative initiative between four
leading [location] universities and major industry partners
such as [compaany] and [compaany]. I chose this program because since
the early days of the AI boom I have been interested in the
development and applications of artificial intelligence,
especially LLMs. I was proud to be among the first 100
students across [location] selected for this highly competitive
program. I am enthusiastic not only about studying AI, but
also contributing to its advancement, and the Summer SchooL
can be an important next step in this journey.
In February, I participated in a project schooL organized by
[compaany] Data SchooL and [compaany]. Working in a cross-university
team alonside students from [compaany], we developed a
project under the supervision of [name]. Our work
focused on methods for hallucination detection in large
language models and was based on the preprint “Hallucination
Detection in LLMs via Topological Divergence on Attention
Graphs” which [name] shared with us.
Seeing [name] among the organizers of the Summer SchooL, and
one of the paper’s co-authors, [name] [surname], as a
speaker, I am especially motivated to attend. I believe this
experience will allow me to dig deeper into this topic, expand
my understanding of LLM internals, and connect with
researchers who are actively shaping the field.
I also attended the AI Journey conference in [location] last
December. Although it was a short event, it provided me with
valuable experience and drove my interest in participating in
more long-term and immersive programs that allow deeper
learning and more engagement.
In the future, I’m looking forward to pursuing a
research-oriented career in machine learning, with a focus on
NLP. The Summer SchooL of ML would be a significant step
toward this aim, giving me the opportunity to learn from
leading researchers. I believe that this experience will help
me grow both academically and professionally, and I would be
happy to be a part of this program.
