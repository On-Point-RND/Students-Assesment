Dear Organizing Committee,
I am excited to apply for the Summer School on Generative
Intelligence. I am passionate about advancing my knowledge and
skills at the intersection of robotics and generative AI. During my
studies, I have always been interested in the idea of combining
deep learning methods, especially generative models, with robotics.
I'm interested in your summer school because it's a special chance
to learn directly from the best researchers and practitioners in this
very modern field.
My current research at [compaany]'s Mobile Robotics Laboratory
is on improving classical algorithms that plan how robots move, like
the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI), by combining modern
machine learning and generative approaches. I have been trying
out diffusion models as an alternative to traditional Gaussian
sampling in MPPI. While the first results showed a lot of promise,
they also showed some big problems, especially with simple
methods of learning that led to problems like transition collapse. I
am excited to attend your program to learn more about how to apply
generative models to improve real-time robotics control.
I really value the collaborative and interdisciplinary environment
your summer school fosters. I'm excited to learn from the other
participants and instructors, explore new ideas, and better
understand how generative intelligence can be used in the real
world. I want to improve my technical skills and meet new people in
my field. I hope to make connections that will help me in the future.
In the long term, I want to contribute to the academic
community and industry by doing research and coming up with new
ideas that combine AI and robotics. My goal is to design strong
robotic systems that can adapt to new situations and interact with
people in different ways. The knowledge and insights I gained from
your summer school will be very important in determining the
direction of my research and giving me the advanced tools I need to
achieve my ambitious career goals.
Thank you for looking at my application. I am excited to
contribute to and learn from the lively intellectual community at your
summer school.
Sincerely, [name] [surname]
