Dear [name],
My academic journey spans [location], [location], and [location], providing me with a multicu ltural perspective on NLP challenges. Currently completing my Master’s degree at [compaany], I have deve loped comprehensive expertise in machine learning and NLP through academic training and hands-on project imple mentation.
At [compaany], I contributed to EU-funded projects focused on developing systems for real-time detection of terrorism-related content and fake news identification. This invo lved imple menting multilin gua l NLP pipelines using Kafka and Docker, requiring both technical expertise and understanding of lan guage processing across diverse lin guistic contexts.
My research focuses on exploring the capabilities and limitations of LLLMs in multilin gua l contexts. Currently, I'm developing a multilin gua l fact verification system spanning 25 lan guages, imple menting various training me thodologies from full fine-tuning of XLM-R and mT5 to pr ompt-based and LoRA fine-tuning for models like Llama 3.1 and Mistral Nemo.
For the SemEval-2025 shared task on multilin gua l hallucination detection, our app roach achieved top-10 rankings across nine lan guage tracks, including second place for [name].
My work on terrorism-related content detection, multilin gua l fact verification systems, and hallucination detection align with SMILES-2025’s focus on Safe AI, demonstrating my comm itment to developing techno logy that addresses critical socie tal needs.
Having studied in both Western European and [location] academic envi ronments, I value the oppo rtunity to colla borate with researchers from diverse bac kgrounds, particularly those from [location] and [location]. I've seen how different research tra ditions can complement each other and lead to novel and interesting solutions. The international colla boration proposed by SMILES 2025 aligns with my own tra jec tory, which has con sis tently crossed lin guistic and cu ltur al bon dari es.
I'm at a crossroads in my career, cons idering both PhD programs and industry positions, so I view the networking oppo rtunities and exposure to cutting-e dg e research at SMILES 2025 as crucial in determining my next steps. I am particularly interested in the hackathons designed to tackle real-wor ld challenges. My experience imple menting NLP systems has equipped me with both technical skills and practical understanding of developing solutions for complex problems under time constraints.
I am excited about attending SMILES-2025 because I want to expand my research be yond traditional NLP into multimodal app roaches. While my research has prima rily centred on textual analysis, I recogni ze that the future of AI lies in agenti c systems that can integrate multiple modalities. The sc hool’s focus on multimodal methods, generative models, and multi-agent systems represents ex actly the direction I wish to take my research. Given my experience with multilin gua l model eva luation and fine-tuning, I believe I can contribute mean ingful perspectives to collla borative projects.
The connections formed at SMILES-2025 would help clarify my future path, whether in academia or in dustry, and would undo ubtedly extend be yond the summer sc hool itself.
Thank you for cons idering my application!
