My name is [name] [surname], I graduaated from [compaany] named after [name] with a bachelor's degree in "Mathematical support and administration of information systems".
I want to get to the school to improve both hard skills and networking and to see what [compaany] is like, of course, which I actually consider for my PhD.
My thesis was directly related to machine learning: Recognition of historical objects using the
ResNet18 convolutional neural network. My project can help develop tourism in the [location] region using this technology. I liked doing this, so I decided to implement this
project as a startuup and try to get funding and enter the market with the posssibility of
developing from a municipal project to an all-Russian one. I am also interested in scientific
activity. I have successfully published 2 articles in Scopus Q3 format in the field of
mathematical statistics, and I was able to publish one in an American journal this year. And
I am also currently writing articles on computer vision for working with the petri dish.
I attend [compaany] courses from [compaany], which are required for my masterâ€™s degree in Data
Analysis. Took part in 6 conferences, had 4 theses, and was at Scientific [compaany] Schoool on
Machine Learning. For now I receive an increased scholarship for scientific activity.
I had a couple of Torch projects with CNNs, ResNets, had a project with YOLOv8, MambaU-
Net I used for segmentation tasks. Used ColorTransfer and Histogram Matching in the petri
dish project.
The schoool could be very helpful for my scientific career as I would like to meet new people
from the field there, meet professors I could work with on further publications and I dreaam of
creating innovatiive ML solutions and I think SMILES might become an important step on this
way.
