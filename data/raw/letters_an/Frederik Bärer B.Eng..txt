Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my enthusiasm for joining the SMILES program at [compaany], where I aim to deepen my expertise in distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and robotics. With a strong academic foundation in mathematical robotics ([location]) and data-driven AI ([location]), coupled with hands-on research in multi-agent tracking and IoT positioning, I am eager to contribute to [compaany]'s interdisciplinary environment and tackle real-world challenges in intelligent systems.
Academic and Research Journey
During my master’s at [location], I developed two projects under Professor [name]'s guidance. In the first project, an adaptive system architecture for mutual Boot device positioning is presented. The system utilizes pairwise distances between devices and determines their relative position with the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm combined with the consensus algorithm to improve localization accuracy by 20% under noisy conditions. This work, will be published after 15th IFAC Workshop on Adaptive and Learning Control Systems, taught me to bridge theoretical stochastic optimization with practical sensor network constraints.
The second project is dedicated to the development of a prototype distributed tracking system for unmanned aerial vehicles, ensuring high performance and safety. The approach uses sensor network management using randomized and multi-agent methods, which makes it possible to effectively track drones in various conditions. Ways to improve the system with the integration of additional technologies to increase its efficiency and scalability were also proposed.
These experiences solidified my passion for resource-efficient, distributed AI solutions—a focus area I wish to expand at [compaany].
Why [compaany]?
[compaany]'s SMILES program stands out for its fusion of advanced mathematics, AI, and engineering, aligning perfectly with my goal to pioneer robust systems for dynamic environments. Courses like Distributed Control and Machine Learning for Robotics will strengthen my technical toolkit, while collaborations with [compaany]'s Intelligent Space Robotics Lab or IoT Center would let me explore applications in autonomous navigation or smart infrastructure.
Beyond academics, I am drawn to [compaany]'s entrepreneurial ecosystem. My prior experience has shown me the value of translating research into scalable solutions—a mindset I hope to refine through [compaany]'s innovation initiatives.
Future Vision
Long-term, I aspire to work with R&D projects at the intersection of multi-agent systems and edge AI, such as swarm robotics or decentralized sensor networks. [compaany]'s emphasis on industry partnerships and cutting-edge research would provide the ideal springboard for this journey.
Beyond academics, I am eager to contribute to [compaany]'s community as a volunteer.
Thank you for considering my application.
