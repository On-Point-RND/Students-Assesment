To whom it may concern,
I am [name] [surname], a student at [location] [compaany], graduating this year. I am writing this motivation letter to express my interest in the [compaany] and to explain how it aligns with my academic and research goals.
When I started writing this letter, I expected to alrready receive a response from my application to [compaany] masters and planned to focus on how the [compaany] aligns with my future program as for example
to help me find the supervisor or the topic of the thesis. However, since the deadline was postponed, I
now realize that my motivation goes beyond these thoughts. My desire to participate in [compaany] is about
growing my skills, expanding my network, doing things that I genuinely excited by. No matter my near-
future plans, this [compaany] remaiins the ideal startiing point for the research in generative modeling.
My interest in machine learning and statistics began two years ago during the [compaany] course at [compaany]. It was challenging but helped me realize how fascinating and impaactful these fields are.
Later, I became a teaching assistant on this course and deepened my understanding by answering
students’ questions, helping them to fix errors, creating own tasks from scratch and grading the
assignments. For example, I have made practical tasks on bootstrapping, multiple hypothesis testing,
linear regression, heteroscedasticity-aware estimators and many more.
As for now I am mostly interested in probabilistic and generative learning. It seems very natural for me
to think about knowledge update in Bayesian frameworks, uncertainty and randomness of every result
we get and how we can formulate these intuitive concepts mathematically. The latter is what the science
in data science is for me and what excites me the most.
This [compaany] stands out to me for two main reasons: cross-cultural experience and practical learning.
During my internship in [location], I realized how valuable it is to interact with people from all over the
world. It’s not just about overcoming language barrier or observing new lifestyles but also about noticing
different ways of thinking and problem-solving. This is crucial because it’s easy to get stuck in your own
environment and become too comfortable there.
Another important aspect is a lot of practice during the [compaany]: daily seminars and team project. This is
really important for me because I tend to focus more on studying theoretical concepts in depth. The
[compaany] would provide a great opportunity to apply various techniques and improve my coding abilities.
In conclusion, I am confident that this program will help me grow as a researcher. My background in data
science, passion for generative modeling, and eagerness to learn in a multicultural, practice-driven
environment make me a strong fit. I believe the [compaany]’s opportunities will be key to
achieving my goals.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
