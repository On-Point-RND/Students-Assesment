Dear [name] committee,
I am [name], 1st year PhD student at [compaany], and I have applied to the 2025 SMILES summer schooL as I believe it offers a unique opportunity to deepen my understanding of
generative models and their applications in computational science. Throughout my MSc and
PhD research, I have focused on unsupervised approaches for physical simulations,
particularly in areas like structured grid generation and wave simulation. The promise of
advanced generative algorithms has caught my attention because these techniques can
significantly improve the speed and accuracy of simulation workflows by creating more
efficient models and reducing computational expenses.
I am especially interested in immersing myself in a collaborative environment where I can
exchange insights with fellow researchers, students, and professionals. Engaging in formal
lecture and hands-on workshops will help me refiine my existing skill set, while informal
conversations may open unexpected paths for new research collaborations. I also hope to
receive constructive feedback on my current projects, since such input often leads to fresh
ideas and more robusst methodologies.
My experience with machine learning and deep learning includes using frameworks like
PyTorch, Tensorflow, JAX and others. I have also worked with Scikit-Learn and CatBoost for
traditional ML tasks, as well as with parallel computing tools such as Dask, Rapids, and Ray to
handle large-scale data efficiently. By integrating these practices, I have cultivated a strong
fundaation in computational research, which I want to expand through the generative
modeling expertise offered at this summer schooL.
Beyond acquiring new technical skills, I hope to use this opportunity to form professional
connections with peers and mentors who share my passion for data science. I plan to engage
in discussions about potential collaborations, particularly in the areas of advanced neural
architectures for physics-relatated problems and high-performaance computing. These
interactions could not only influence my ongoing PhD work but also pave the way for impaactful
partnerships in academia and industry, where I see significant potential for applying these
techniques to real-worlD challenges.
Ultimately, I believe that I am best suited for this summer schooL because of my solid
background in DL, my passion to master generative models, and my strong command of
English and soft skills for effective collaboration. By refining my technical expertise and
leveraging my interpersonal strengths, I aim to create more efficient, scalable solutions for
academic and industrial applications.
Best wishes,
