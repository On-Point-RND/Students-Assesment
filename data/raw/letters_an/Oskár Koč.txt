Dear [name] [surname] Admissions Committee,
I am an early-career researcher specializing in machine learning applications for real-world challenges, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). My recent work on developing tabular question-answering systems using large language models (LLMs) achieved a top-13 ranking at SemEval 2025, and I have a forthcoming publication at workshop at [company], which showcases my dedication to advancing AI technologies ( safely :) ). Given SMILES 2025's focus on AI validation, generative models and interdisciplinary collaboration, I believe this summer school provides the perfect environment to further explore safe AI â€”an area I am passionate about.
My current research revolves around developing robust evaluation techniques for misaligned LLMs, working under the guidance of a mentor from [company]. Through this work, I have gained valuable insights into the importance of AI safety and validation, areas that are often underexplored yet critical for the responsible development of future technologies. Attending SMILES 2025 would provide an excellent opportunity to collaborate with like-minded researchers and learn from experts. I am eager to exchange ideas with attendees from diverse backgrounds, all working toward the shared goal of advancing AI in a secure and ethical manner.
Growing up in [location], I faced the challenge of limited exposure to a research-oriented academic environment. Motivated by a desire for more rigorous intellectual challenges, I moved to [location] to study at the [company], one of Russia's leading research institutions. This transition was a significant leap that has sharpened my ability to adapt and thrive in competitive academic settings. I now seek to further my research career by participating in an international, multidisciplinary environment such as SMILES 2025, where I can contribute my experience and learn.
Thank you for considering my application.
