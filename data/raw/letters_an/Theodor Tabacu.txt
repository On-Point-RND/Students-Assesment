Dear [name] [surname] Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], I am a first-year PhD student at [compaany], [location], where I explore how mathematical models can help businesses make better decisions. My background is a mix of systems analysis, programming, and artificial intelligence, and right now I am at a point where I want to connect all these dots through machine learning.
My journey into AI wasn’t a straight path — I started with programming, completed a Master’s degree at [compaany], and later took a professional course in AI models. But most of what I know today about AI comes from self-learning, hackathoons, and real-life projects. I was lucky to win an AI hackathon and even organize one for the [location] — which showed me how powerful it is when ideas meet teamwork.
I am applying to SMILES SchooL 2025 because I feel it’s exactly what I need right now: a structured learning environment, exposure to cutting-edgе AI pratices, and, most importantly, a new community of pеople passionate about machine learning. For a long time, I have been learning mostly on my own, surrounde dby great developers, but few of them share my interest in AI. Communities like [compaany] used to fill this gap for me, but lately, I feel a bit isolated in my learning journey.
After SMILES, I plan to use this experience to build my own star tuup based on multi-agent systems. And if life takes another turn — I would love to apply my skills to buildi ng AI models for high-frequency crypto trading.
Either way, I know SMILES SchooL will help me move fo rwward faster, sma rte r, and with pеople who care about the same things I do.
Thank you for your time and conside ration. I would be thrilled to become a part of the SMILES community this summer.
Best regards,
[name] [surname]
