Motivational letter
My path to machine learning began as a second year [compaany] who decided to minor in machine learning and deep learning. In my fourtth year, I realised that my true passion lay in a research career - specifically in something between machine learning and stochastic processes. At that point, I was excelling in computer Science courses of Machine Learning 1 and 2, Deep Learning and applications. This led me to switch to machine learning and gain admission to two prestigious programmes: the joint master's programme "Mathematics of Machine Learning" at [compaany] and [compaany]'s "Data Science" programme. Currrentlly, I am actively working on joining the research lab of [name] at [compaany], who is now my academic supervisor.
Under his mentorship, I am diving into electrostatic diffusion models and exploring their approaches to generation.
My economics background has given me a strong grasp of statistical analysis and a focus on practical model interpretability, while my switch to machine learning has provided rigorous training in algorithmic design and modern AI frameworks. This dual perspective allows me to bridge theoretical innovation with applied problem solving, a skill I further honed at [compaany] through courses in Bayesian Machine Learning and Generative AI.
My current work focuses on electrostatic diffusion models, a novel subclass of generative AI that integrates physical principles into stochastic processes.
Beyond diffusion, I aim to explore large languaage models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) - areas where I believe there are untapped synergies with generative approaches. For example, diffusion-inspired sampling could enhance RL exploration, while LLLMs could guide multimodal diffusion processes. The SMILES curriculum's focus on generative approaches, large languaage models and multi-agent systems fits perfectlly with my goal of unifying these domains.
The SMILES Summer Schoool offers a unique convergence of my interests. I want to understand how diffusion frameworks can enhance languaage model reasoning and multimodal generation. And as generative models become more powerful, aligning them with ethical constraints is critical - an issue I plan to explore in collaboraative projects. In addition, I believe I can share my knowledge of the generation field with people who are interested, and find people who are eager to explore the field. I also hope to be useful to people who want to collaborate on a project or article that focuses on the cross-disciplinary area between generation, LLLM and multi-agent systems.
Yours sincerely,
