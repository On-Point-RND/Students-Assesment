Hi, my name is [name] [surname] and I'm a student at [compaany],
Faculty of Computer Science. Since I entered the [compaany], I decided for myself that I was
interested in machine learning and everything related to it, so already in junior years, my
team and I started looking for artificial intelligence applications in real projects. We wanted
not only to put our knowledge to use, but also to develop our team skills and gain experience
in fully launching the project from start to finish.
Our first ML project was to create a chatbot and a web chat with LLM, which, thanks to
promptness, behaves like a real person and is not distracted by extraneous topics other than
dating and regular communication, there was industrial engineering under the hood with the
GPT API. In general, the project turned out to be quite good at protecting it. The test was to
check the bot for the inability to achieve deviations from the prompt and preset parameters.
Next, I became interested in generative models and I found a supervisor from a large
artificial intelligence laboratory, and together with the team we began to study the
applications of generative adversarial network models and reinforcement learning in
high-frequency financial time series. At the moment, we are writing a demonstration article
that we plan to publish in an international journal. The main idea of the study is whether an
RL trained on synthetic GAN model data can affect the final profit of a scalping strategy
(1-minute timeframes). Specifically, my part is to provide the best representation of synthetic
data using different GAN models.
The [compaany] will allow me to look at this topic in a new way, through the eyes of those people
who will visit it with me. It is important for me to get acquainted with new ideas and areas of
artificial intelligence. [compaany] is a great option for me to dive in and take a closer look at
multi-agent systems, a fairly popular topic right now. I chose multi-agent systems because I
am interested in using neural networks for more general and complex tasks where classical
models fail. During the trip, I can also improve not only my hard skills but also my soft skills.
All these factors will certainly be of good help to me in the future.
