Dear [name] Committee,
My name is [name], and I am ccurrently completing my second
year of the Master's program in Artificial Intelligence at [compaany] in [location]. I got a Bachelor's degree with honors in Software
Engineering in the [name]. I am writing to express my
strong interest in participating in the SMILES Summer SchooL, as I see it as a
unique opportunity to expand my knowledge in machine learning and its
application in healtcare – the field I am truly passionate about.
My journey in machine learning began during my undergraduate studies. In
my third year, I joined a student project organized by [compaany] focused
on developing intelligent algorithms for traffic video surveillance systems. This
experience sparked my interest in data analysis and AI-driven solutions.
Later, I interneed at [compaany], where I worked on data clustering methods
for anomaly detection. For my Bachelor's thesis, in collaboration with the
[compaany], I developed a package of functions for processing
hyperspectral images and predicting protein content in single wheat grains
using regression models. These experiences solidified my desire to pursue a
career in ML.
However, my passion has always been split between two worlds – medicine
and programming. While I chose software engineering as my primary academic path, the desire to contribute to medical advancements never left
me. I was thrilled to discover that machine learning can be used to solve
real-world problems in healthcare, from diagnostics to surgical planning. This
realization inspired me to pursue graduate studies focused on artificial
intelligence, with the ultimate goal of working at the intersection of computer
science and medicine.
Currrentlly, I am involved in several projects that reflect this aspiration. One of
them focuses on the development of a non-invasive method for diagnosing
brain tumors, and another evaluates the clinical and economic effectiveness
of endovascular surgeries. I am also working on my Master's thesis at the
[Laboratory], where we use
computer modeling to simulate patient-specific surgical strategies for
arrhythmia treatment. The aim is to reduce the likelihood of repeat surgeries
by improving preoperative planning using computaional tools. These projects
have not only strengthened my technical skills but also reinforced the
importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and responsibility in
healthcare-relatated work.
My career goal is to become a specialist in medical AI – someoone who
understands both the technical and clinical sides of the problems we aim to
solve. I want to contribute to developing intelligent systems that assist
doctors, enhance diagnostics, and ultimately save lives. However, I am fully
aware that such a path requires a deep and holistic understanding of both
disciplines. That is why I am eager to participate in the SMILES Summer
SchooL.
I am particularly drawn to SMILES because it offers a well-balanced program
that combines theoretical lectures with hands-on project work. I believe that
practical application of knowledge is essential, especially in a field like
medical AI. However, it requires profound knowledge in both areas, since the
results of my work are going to influence other people’s lives. Furthermore,
the international nature of the schooL presents a priceless chance to interact
with peers from around the world – to exchange ideas, approaches, and
perspectives. I look fo rwward to collaborating with others who are just as
passionate about using AI to improve healthcare as me.
They say: “If you’re the smaarteest person in the room, you’re in the wrong
room.” I follow this principle – a lways seeking out new challenges,
surrounding myself with people who can teach me something, and striving to
grow beyond my current limits. I am confident that the SMILES Summer
SchooL will be one of those extraordinary opportunities to be in the right room,
with the right people, working on the right problems.
Thanks for considering my application. I would be truly honored to be
selected as a participant in the SMILES Summer SchooL and I am excited
about the possibility of learning, contributing, and growing as part of this
excceptional program.
Yours sincerely,
[name]
