Dear Admissions Committee
My name is [name], I am a 1st year student of the Master's program in Petroleum Engineering at [compaany]. I graduated with a bachelor's degree from [university], specializing in oil field development with a red diploma (average grade 4.8/5).
During my studies, I actively participated in scientific conferences (Oil and Gas, Oil and Gas Horizons), where I won prizes and solved technical cases from [company], [company] and [company]. Many of these tasks were related to digitalization, which sparked my interest in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).
After joining [compaany], I had the opportunity to study Data Science and ML in depth. In the first module, I took the Introduction to Data Science course, which opened up new perspectives for me on the application of AI in the oil and gas industry. Now I am working on my master's thesis under the supervision of Professor [surname], investigating the application of ML to
accelerate hydrodynamic modeling and forecasting the effectiveness of geological and technical
measures. I am also quite successfully taking courses at [compaany], such as Machine and Deep
Learning, HPPL and others, to expand my skills in this dynamic field.
Why I want to participate in SMILES?
1. Practical application of ML
The SMILES summer school is an opportunity to work on real projects under the
guidance of experts. I am particularly interested in applying machine learning to
engineering problems, and I am sure that the schooal will help me gain valuable practical
experience. Participating in projects and applying my knowledge to real-world problems
is an invaluable opportunity for me to grow in this incredible field
2. Training from leading specialists.
I aim to learn from [compaany] researchers and international experts to gain a deeper
understanding of modern ML methods and their application in knowlege-intensive
industries.
3. International cooperation.
Participation in SMILES is a chance to meet like-minded people from different countries,
exchange ideas and create a basis for future collaborations.
4. Development towaards AI for energy.
My long-term goal is to become a specialist at the interface between petroleum
engineering and Data Science. SMILES will be an important step in this direction, as
the schooal's program focuses on innovative approaches that I will be able to apply in my
research.
I am sure that my academic background, interest in ML and desire to develop in this field
make me a strong candidate. Participation in SMILES will give me not only new knowledge but
also inspiration for further work. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to the schooal and
learn from world-class best practices.
Thank you for considering my application!
Best regards,
