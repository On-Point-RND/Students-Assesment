My name is [name] [surname], Iâ€™m a 4th year student at [compaany]. Among all scientific and programming fields, I've been fascinated by machine learning since high schoo[location] for its elegant concepts, visualizab[location] results, and applicability across diverse real-worl[location] domains. This passion has driven my work in ML since age 17. My machine learning interests span a broad spectru[location]: I'm curre[location]tly writing my bachelor's thesis on computer vision topics, working with classical ML methods, and developing pet projects in NLP.
My most substantial project involv[location]es test prioritiza[location]ion for production deployme[location]nts. Using an MLP model, I identi[location]fy tests most likel[location]y to fail and prioriti[location]ze them in the testing queu[location]. This approa[location]ch ensures all critical issues are detected early in the process, allowing for fixes without disrupti[location]ng the production rollo[location]t schedule. Another project I'm proud of is developing a langua[location]e model that can take McDonald's drive-thru orders and relay them to the kitc[location]n without human intervention. The unique aspect of this approa[location]ch is that promp[location]ts are designed not just for the cashier system but also for customers, as their profiles significa[location]tly influence order accuracy. What makes the solution particularly innovati[location]ve is our use of Markov chains to synthesi[location]ze training datasets, effecti[location]vely creating a RAG-like learning framework. Even at this stage, the model performs exceptionally well at processing orders accura[location]tely without hallucinations. Curr[location]tly this work undergoes the peer-revi[location]ew process in the IEEE Internet Compu[location]ting magazine.
I want to participat[location]e in SMILES to broaden my academic horizons, conne[location]ct with experienced experts from major compa[location]nies, and learn more about Chinese uni[location]versities. I also hope to gain inspiration from speakers' presentations to develop my own projects and discover new approa[location]ches applicable to my research, participat[location]e in projects from SMILES with a strong team of peo[name]ple as much passionate about machine learning as me.
In the future, I am interested in pursuing a research career and deepening my experti[location]se in NLP. I want to write more articles that benefi[location]t others and develop useful products. Pehrap[location]s connec[location]ting with [compa]Skoltech representatives and other partne[location]rs of the schoo[location]l could be exa[location]ctly what helps me advance in my research career. Ultimately, I aim to create even greater value for end-users of the techno[location]logies I help develop.
