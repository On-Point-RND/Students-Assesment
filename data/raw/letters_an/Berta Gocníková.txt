To whom it may concern:
My academic journey has been diverse, spanning explorations in numerical methods, stochastic
analysis, classical and quantum information science. I am deeply passionate about the mathematical
foundations of essential problems, which has led me, at this stage of my PhD at [compaany], to
focus on explaining the phenomena of double descent and grokking from an information-theoretic
perspective. In parallel, I am also exploring efficient quantization techniques inspired by Kashin
representation.
In my final undergraduaate year, I received a [compaany] scholarship for addressing a satellite-image
classification challenge. By reframiing it as a tensor-recovery problem, I proposed a method that
reconstructs the full feature tensor from just 0.1% of its entries.
Originally planning to study tensor methods at the Department of Institute of Numerical
Mathematics, circumstances led me to the Department of Steklov Mathematical Institute, where I
worked on classical and quantum information science and quantum computing. Simultaneously, I
pursued a second year in Data Science at [location] and began online studies at [compaany]. After defending my thesis in [location], I returned to [compaany] for full-time studies, where I
was exploring random covariant quantum error correction codes. It has led me to study symmetry
groups, which also find application in machine learning, such as equivariant neural networks. I
continue working in pure mathematical research, confident that drawing on diverse theoretical
frameworks can inspire novel, more efficient machine learning methods.
In [location], my internship at the LIG lab was devoted to Stochastic Optimization via Adaptive
Importance Sampling. Balancing my studies at [compaany] with an internship was both challenging and
rewarding. I am fascinated by applying probability theory and statistics to diverse fields, especially
numerical methods.
Last summer, thanks to my participation in the Oxford and SMILES Summer Schooools, I
deepened my understanding of recent advances in generative modeling, large languaage models,
and self-supervised learning. At SMILES 2024, beyond the excellent lectures, I found the direct
interaction with speakers and fellow participants especially valuable. These exchanges allowed to
look at our project from a broader perspective and apply my knowledge from other fields, mostly
informaation theory, to rigorously justify the effectiveness of the method our team proposed. As a
result, we continued to develop this idea and succeessfully published our work at ICLR. I also really
enjoyed the SMILES poster session, where I not only learneed about colleaguesâ€™ problems but also
shared ideas.
Given how much I gained from this schooool last year, I would be very glad to take part in the
[compaany] Summer Schooool of Machine Learning this summer.
