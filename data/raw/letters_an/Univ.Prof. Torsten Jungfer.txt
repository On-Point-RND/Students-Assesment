Motivation letter
Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my interest in joining the SMILES 2025 summer schoo. I have graduaated
from [compaany] in 2015, and has been working mostly in [compaany] since then. Startiing from 2018 and until the last year, I worked in
the United States, including prestigious [compaany], the [compaany].
However, due to increased political tension between our countries, I could not extend my visa
and had to return to [location], where I have since struggled to find a position that matches my
expertise and ambitions, as frankly speaking, there is no real bioengineering market in [location].
These challenges have motivated me to move my professional career towaards Deep and
Machine Learning, hoping it could help me to combiine my strong engineering, mathematical
and scientific background with the rapidlly growing and perspective technology, that clearly
have a huge market both inside my country, and worldwide.
My career in bioengineering has been marked by several breakthroughs that has been
published in top in top-tier journals in my area, including prestigious [compaany].
You can find more information on my [email] account
(https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCKXqLcAAAAJ&hl=en). These achievements,
reflect not only my technical skills but also my dedication to advancing knowledge in the life
sciences, ability to clearly write and express my results, and demonstrated the wide area of
professional skills.
Throughout my research, I have developed a foundation in programming, statistics and data
analysis, experimental design, visualization, and interdisciplinary collaboraation. I have worked
extensively with computational models, including hydrodynamic stimulation, developed
complicated mathematical models, and employed statistical methods to validate the results.
These experiences have honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities that are
highly transferable to the field of machine learning.
The decision to pivot from bioengineering to machine learning was driven by both practical and
intellectual considerations. The job market of machine learning is rapidly expanding, offering
greater career prospects, higher salaries, and the potential to make a significant impaact across
industries. More importantly, I am deeply fascinated by the potential of machine learning to
revolutionize scientific research and healtcare. I believe that integrating machine learning with
my background in biology and bioengineering will enable me to contribute to cutting-edge
solutions in personalized medicine, drug discovery, and beyond. This intersection is where I see
the most exciting opportunities for innovation and socieetal benefiit.
I hope that participation in your program would provide me with the technical knowledge
required for a successful transition and will help me to establiish a network in the mew area. I
am eager to learn from leading experts, collaborate with other participants, and contribute my
own perspective as a scientist with experience in biologicaal research. Additionally, I see this
program as a gateway to buildiing a professional network that will support my career
development. I am particularly interested in connecting with people who share my passion for
interdisciplinary research and who can guide me as I navigate this new field.
I hope my research background, publication record, and analytical skills provide a strong
foundation for being invited as a participant to the SMILE 2025.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to
and learning from your program.
Sincerely,
[name]
