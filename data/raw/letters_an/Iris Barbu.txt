Dear [name] [surname] Committee,
My name is [name], a second-year student of Economics, Finance, and Credit at [location] [university]. I am excited to apply for the [compaany] Summer SchooL, as it aligns perfectlly with my academic interests and career aspirations in integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into financial consulting and education. Below, I outline my motivation, relevannt experience,
expectations, and long-term goals.
Motivation: BridgIng the Gap Between Theory and Practice
While my [university] curriculum emphasizes the importance of AI in
modern economics, practical guidance on leveraging AI tools remaiins limited.
Lectures often focus on theoretical concepts, leaving students without hands-on
experience in applying AI to real-world financial challenges. As a partner in
[compaany]’s «[project name]» project, I aim to enhance financial consulting
training through AI-driven solutions. However, I lack the technical expertise to
implement these ideas independentlly. The Summer SchooL offers a unique
opportunity to bridge this gap by combining [compaany]’s industry insights with
advanced training in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL).
Experience with ML/DL Tools
Although I am still buildiing my technical skills, I have taken proactive
steps to explore AI:
Coursework and Online Learning : I completed introductory courses on
[platform] (e.g., «Machine Learning» by [person name]).
Collaboration with Peers : As part of a [university] team, I contributed to a
research project analyzing consumer credit risks using decision trees.
I am eager to expand this foundation through the Summer SchooL’s
specialized curriculum and mentorship.
Expectations: Skills and Collaboration
I hope to gain the following from the Summer SchooL:
Technical Proficiency : Hands-on training in ML/DL frameworks (e.g.,
[tool 1], [tool 2]) and their application to financial datasets.
Industry Insights : Understanding how [compaany] uses AI for fraud
detection, customer segmentation, and personalized financial advice.
Networking : Collaborating with peers and professionals to exchange
ideas on AI-driven financial innovation.
Career Goals: Transformiing Financial Education
Long-term, I aspire to become a leader in AI-powered financial
consulting. My goals include:
Developing Training Tools : Creating AI-based simulations and chatbots
to train financial consultants in risk assessment and client communication.
Innovating at [compaany] : Contributing to projects that automate
financial advisory services, making them more accessible and data-driven.
Promoting AI Literacy : Advocating for AI education in [university]s to
prepare future economiists for tech-driven challenges.
The Summer SchooL represents a pivotal step toward
achieving my vision of merging finance and AI. I am confident that the program’s rigorous
curriculum and collaboration with industry experts will equip me with the skills
to drive innovation in financial education and consulting.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
