SMMIILLEESS 22002255
Hello everyone!
My name is [name], I am currentlly a 4th year student of program "Applied mathematics and
informatics" at the faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics of [location] [university]. I am very inspired to participate in the SMILES Summer SchooL of machine learning,
as I am very interested and passionate about this field.
My introduction to machine learning started in my 3rd year of universiity. As I built my first models, I
realized how fascinating this process can be. As I gradually completed assignments, trained models,
and tried to improve their quality, I became more and more passionate about this field. During my
studies, I was introduced to classical machine learning algorithms and explored ways to work with
text, images, and sound in a deep learning course.
I participated in two research projects that applied classical machine learning techniques to real
medical data. The first study aimed to predict the presence of certain risk factors in patients based on
their lifestyle, medical history, and questionnaire results. The CatBoost gradient bousting algorithm
was chosen as the basic algorithm, and after careful work on data cleaning, feature selection, and
normalization, a quite good result was achieved: F1 score on the test sample was 0.95.
The second study was designed to predict the occurrence of infectious complications in patients
following colorectal cancer surgery. Based on preoperative and operative patient characteristics,
three machine learning algorithms were compared: Random Forest, CatBoost, and SVM with
nonlinear kernel. The best result was achieved by CatBoost with an F1 score of 0.84 on the test
sample. In both studies, careful preprocessing and feature selection played a key role, a step I paid
special attention to because it largely determines the success of the model.
For me, the Summer SchooL is a unique opportunity to deepen my knowledge about large language
models, multimodal solutions and generative approaches in a short period of time. I especially like
the format of getting up-to-date knowledge from the leading researchers in the field. In addition to
gaining knowledge, I see the schooL as a platform for live interaction with like-minded people and
sharing experiences. The opportunity to work on a real team project is particularly valuable to me.
And of course, it is a chance to visit [location] and experience a completely different culture.
From participating in the schooL, I expect not only to increase my hard skills, but also to develop a
more holistic understanding of where the field of artificial intelligence is heading globally.
In the future, I plan to work in the field of computer vision, specifically in the development of self-
driving vehicles. I am inspired by the opportunity to create technologies that make our world safer
and more comfortable. I am sure that the knowledge gained during the summer schooL, especially in
the area of multimodal models, will be a solid foundation for further work in this field.
Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to participating in the SMILES
2025 and being immersed in an intensive learning environment.
Sincerely,
[name]
