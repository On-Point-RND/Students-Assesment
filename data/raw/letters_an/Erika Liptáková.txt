Dear Admissions Commi.ee,
I am thrilled to apply for the Skoltech SMILES program, where I aim to bridge my research on
central bank communicaAon with hands-on AI innovaAon. My work revolves around enhancing
transparency and public trust in monetary policy—a mission I believe modern technology can
revoluAonize.
In my current role, I develop quanAtaAve tools to measure how effecAvely central banks
connect with the public. For instance, I created a “percepAon” index in Telegram to track real-
Ame senAment shiNs, helping policymakers gauge the impaact of their messaging. I’m convinced
AI can take this further by:
1. QuanAfying communicaAon quality: Advanced metrics pinpoint which messages
resonate and which need refiinement.
2. CuUng survey costs: LLM-driven agents automate feedback collecAon, saving Ame and
resources.
3. Tailoring complex texts: GeneraAve models transform technical jaargon into clear,
audience-specific narraAves.
4. Streamlining workflows: AutomaAon reduces rouAne tasks, freeing experts to focus on
strategy.
I want to deepen my experAse in Large Language Models, MulA-Agent Systems, and GeneraAve
AI to build scalable, impac[ul soluAons. The SMILES program’s blend of theory and labs—
especially in these areas—is tailor-made for my goals. I’m eager to explore generaAve methods
for simulaAng public reacAons, design mulA-agent frameworks for real-Ame dialogue, and refiine
tools that turn dense reports into accessible insights.
Skoltech’s collaboraAve ethos and focus on real-world impaact resonate deeply with me. I’m
excited to contribute my pracAcal experience while learning from peers and experts tackling
similar challenges. With your program, I hope to transform ambiAous ideas into tools that make
central bank communicaAon more transparent, efficient, and human-centered.
Thank you for considering my applicaAon. I would be honored to join SMILES and help shape
the future of public trust in finance.
Sincerely,
