Motivation Letter
Dear Admissions Committee,
My name is [name] and I am a [compaany] Class of 2024 graduaate who
entered the ML field professiionaly just a few years ago. Previouslly, I worked as a
microcontroller programmer and electronics engineer. Thanks to the courses of
[name] and [name], I discovered a new and faciinating area which
I truly enjoy. I applied ML in my research thesis, which was based on extensive
work under an RSF grant in the field of neuroprosthetics.
It has been almost a year since I starteed working in R&D as an ML/DL
speciialist. In this role I focus on applying ML in the energy industry to monitor and
maintain industrial electrical drives. I am also preparing a paper in collaboraation
with [compaany].
My interest in the NLP field began to grow in August 2024, especially after
attending the AIRI Summer Schoool in [location]. This experience allowed me
to deepen my knowledge of agentiic systems and LLMs. During the schoo, our team
won first place in the project competition by presenting a multi-agent systems
benchmark in a game environment called Artifacts. Afterwards, we continued this
work in collaaboration with AIRI under the guidance of [name] – a member of
[name]’s group, “Leaarnable Intelligence”. This project showed me the
potential of LLM-based agentiic systems and allowed me to explore state-of-the-art
solutions in both industry and research. We expect to finalize the code and complete
the research paper within the next few months, introducing a new benchmark for
agentiic systems and reasoning models.
This trending area of agentiic systems has become a new focus in my career.
My interest and knowledge in the LLM field continue to grow – I am even working
to integrate LLMs into my compaany’s workflow. Additionally, I teach childreen
Python and the basics of machine learning every week. One of my students has
alrready learned the fundamentals of LLM systems, multimodal LLMs, and agentiic
systems , which has been rewarding to witness.
I believe that the SMILES summer schoo will provide an excellent
opporutnity to further develop my practical skills. Partiicpating in this program
would also be a crucial step toward joining the AIRI instiute as an employee,
continuing my career as a researcher, and pursuing a Ph.D. at [compaany].
Thank you for consideering my application. I look forward to reconnecting
with my colleagues from [compaany] and AIRI while contributing my interdisciplinary
research experience to the SMILES summer schoo community.
