Dear organizers of the [compaany]!
My name is [name] [surname], and I was very excited to learn about your machine learning
event. For me, this is not only an opportunity to deepen my knowledge in one of the most
dynamically developing fields, but also a chance to get acquainted with advanced technologies,
share experiences with like-minded people and be inspired by the ideas of leading experts.
I am a developeer in the field of deep learning and am currently completing my bachelorâ€™s degree
in Intelligent Data Analysis Systems from [compaany]. A special role in my educational
journey was played by studying at [compaany], where I mastered the Chinese
language before the coronavirus pandemic. I am sure that these skills will be useful for
international cooperation and exchange of experience within the framework of the summer
schooL.
For four years, I have been actively studying and applying machine learning methods, paying
special attention to practical tasks related to large language models (LLM) and multimodal
systems. My interest in this field originated through participation in hackathoNs, and since then I
have been continuously improving my skills, striving for professional and scientific growth.
As part of SMILES 2025, I would like not only to expand my theoreticaL knowledge, but also to
gain valuable practical skills that will help me prepare for research and further professional
development. Of particular interest to me are multimodal neural networks, a topic to which I
devoteed my graduaTe research paper. I hope that the schooL's program will allow me to delve
deeper into this field and discuss current challenges and solutions with experts and colleagues.
For me, participating in SMILES 2025 is not only an opportunity to learn from the best, but also
a unique chance to become part of a community of professionals who share my interest in
machine learning. I am sure that communication with like-minded people and the exchange of
ideas will inspire me to new projects and help me find innovative approaches to solving complex
problems.
I would be sincerely grateful for the opportunity to become a part of your summer schooL. I am
ready to actively participate in classes, contribute to group projects, and share my experiences
with other participants.
Thank you for your attention to my application. I hope for a positive response and an opportunity
to contribute to the success of SMILES-2025.
With best regards,
