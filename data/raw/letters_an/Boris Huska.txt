I am excited to apply for this AI Summer School to deepen my expertise in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) and bridge the gap between my current technical knowledge and cutting-edge AI applications. My career has been defined by leading data-driven transformations across finance, pharmaceuticals, and technology, but I recognize that mastering advanced AI methodologies will be critical to solving tomorrow’s business challenges.
My Ph.D. research in Mathematical Methods in Economics involved designing automated control systems, sparking my interest in AI’s potential to optimize complex processes. Later, at [compaany], I built ML models (Python, Dataiku) to create predictions on oncology patients’ survivability and improve sales forecasting by 30%, and at [location], I explored AI applications in venture capital. However, I now seek structured, rigorous training to advance beyond applied tools and understand the theoretical foundations of modern AI—particularly deep learning, reinforcement learning, and generative AI.
This program’s focus on multimodal and deep learning research aligns perfectly with my goal of becoming a leader who can both develop AI solutions and integrate them strategically across industries.
My hands-on experience with ML/DL includes development of predictive models (Scikit-learn, Pandas) for sales forecasting ([compaany]) and KPI optimization ([compaany]). Also, I have some experience in building end-to-end AI workflows for working capital optimization for reducing reporting errors. Finally, I designed automated dashboards with embedded ML insights for private equity portfolio monitoring.
While I’ve leveraged these tools operationally, I aim to strengthen my grasp of neural networks (e.g., TensorFlow/PyTorch), unsupervised learning, and AI ethics through this program.
At the summer school, I hope to gain fluency in DL architectures (CNNs, RNNs, transformers) and their applications in finance and healthcare, contribute to projects aligning with my interests—e.g., AI for predictive analytics in venture capital or process automation in energy. And also, learn from peers and faculty tackling AI’s toughest challenges, from scalability to bias mitigation. This school’s classes will provide the ideal environment to test theories in practice.
In the next 1-3 years, I plan to leverage the knowledge gained from this program to advance both my financial and healthcare AI initiatives. At my private equity fund, I will implement deep learning for enhanced real estate valuation using transformer architectures to analyze market trends and graph neural networks to optimize portfolio risk assessment, while also launching an AI advisory service to help startups in emerging markets adopt cutting-edge technologies. Simultaneously, I will expand my research on multiple myeloma treatment optimization by testing neural networks to complement the good but limited results achieved with boosted trees and random forests, aiming to develop more accurate predictive models for treatment sequencing. This dual focus will allow me to drive innovation in both finance and healthcare, applying advanced AI techniques to create tangible impact across sectors while establishing a foundation for my long-term vision of commercializing AI solutions that address complex real-world challenges.
In the long-term, I plan to found a venture studio focused on AI-first companies, combining my MBA and technical training to commercialize research in healthcare and energy.
This SMILE2025 program will equip me to not only use AI but also shape its ethical adoption across industries. I’m eager to contribute my cross-sector experience while learning from this community.
