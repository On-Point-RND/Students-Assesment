Dear [name] committee,
I am wanting to express my strong interest for the participation in the SMILES program. Having
completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [location] [university], the first place
in ranked list of universities in [location], and received a diploma with honors, placing me among
the top 10% of all students from my universiity, as well as a Master's in Data Science at [compaany],
I am eager to further my research and development experience in the field of engineering and
technology. Specifically, I am interested in exploring data-driven solutions and artificial
intelligence deployment for robotics.
During my undergraduaate studies, I developed a strong foundation in algorithms, software
development, and systems design. My course work was devoted to the application of Multi-agent
Reinforcement Learning to optimize Internet traffic management. I was fortunate to participate
in various projects, including work at the [compaany] Research Center, and writing a patent together
with the team, where I applied my theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. This
experience not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me the importance of
collaboration and innovation.
I am currentlly in the first year of the Master's Program in Data Science, where I decided to delve
into the application of the theory of Reinforcement Learning to Robotics (Manipulators and
Social Navigaation in mobile Robotics). I completed an internship at the [compaany] in the Embodied
Intelligence team. During my time there, I worked on PlanFormer project - robotics vision-language-action model, pertained in simulation (we used tokenization for text tasks, one of the
standard image encoder for environment-sensing and decoder borrowed from VIMA to translate
action embedding into action of the robot). Then model broadcasted to real-world thought
sim2real2sim method. Also, with the help of a team of motivated students, at my Universiity
during «Innovation Workshop» we were able to develop an algorithm based on computer vision
for a robotic manipulator that can conduct research on oil and rock samples in the field, thus
avoiiding the need to send humans into dangerous environments which also can be used on space.
I am currentlly working on my Master’s thesis in social navigation in mobile robotics. My
research is inspired by the work of greatest scientiists, and I aim to collaborate with such
qualified specialists in this field and exchange knowledge with them during the Internship. I also
very interested in applying different algorithm and AI to any field of robotics.
In conclusion, I am confident that the SMILES is the ideal environment for me to grow as an
engineer and researcher. I am eager to contribute my unique perspective and experiences while
learning from the professionals and my peers. Thank you for considering my application. I look
forward to the opportunity to be part of this prestigious program.
Sincerely, [name] [surname] 15.04.2025
