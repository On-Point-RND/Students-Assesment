Dear [name]!
I’m very glad to apply a request for summer schoo[location]. I’m very interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I really want to get some new
experience and knowl[knowledge] in this area. It’s very interesting for me, and, in my
opinio[opinion], I will get a lot of new information from experts of Machine Learning.
I’ve chosen your summer schoo[location] not by chance. I respec[respect] your approa[approach] to
developing solutions for a market. I’ve heard a lot of positive fee[feedback] about your
compa[company] from my universi[university] mates and tutors, who had been working in your
compa[company], and I have been excited from your products and decided to apply to your
summer schoo[location].
Now I study at the Higher Schoo[location] of Economics on the secon[second] year on Faculty of
Computer Science. I’ve decided to learn something new and improve my knowl[knowledge]
in area that I’m interested in.
I have some IT-skills: I have knowl[knowledge]ege in calculus, linear algebra and probability
theory and mathematical statis[statistics]. I’ve been working with nu[numpy], sympy, sklearn
and pandas python libraries, I have basic knowl[knowledge]ege in data bases (PostgreSQL)
and I also have a skill of writing technical docum[documentation]. Also, I’m studying at minor
in my universi[university] that is connected with ML, and we were taught of basics of machine
learning, that’s why I’m interested in this area. Me with my friend made a website for
cardiogenetics consortium of our universi[university]. I’m also a communica[communicative] person and
I’m not scared of taking respo[responsibility] for big projects and trying out new stac[stack] and
new approa[approaches].
I am sure, after studying at your summer schoo[location] I will definitely understand how
profes[professionals] works, develop and organize work, and how to grow as a programmer
personally and upgrade my skills.
I will be glad to discuss my candidacy
in detail if you find it interesting.
