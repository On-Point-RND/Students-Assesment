Motivation Letter
Dear [name] Committee,
My name is [name]. I am a first-year PhD student at [compaany] in the Computational Data Science and Engineering program, where I’m researching generative approaches in data augmentation under the supervision of Professor [surname]. I’m also working as a Deep Learning Engineer at [compaany], where I explore how generative models can be used for teaching robots through behavior cloning. My current research is focused on computer vision, video generation, and the connection between language, vision,
and action in intelligent systems. I believe robots are becoming not just tools, but
learners—and this direction inspires me deeply.
During my Master’s studies at [compaany], I had my first real experience with Deep
Learning. I studied both Machine Learning and Deep Learning in detail, and this shaped my
interest in robotics from a new angle. I began to see how smart algorithms could give real
machines the ability to understand, adapt, and interact with the world around them. Right
now, I am especially impressed by the progress in Reinforcement Learning. Some of the
results we see in robot control are honestlly surprising—even robots doing things that many
people might struggle with. One of the most exciting questions in our field, which many
researchers are now trying to answer, is how to build embodied AI that can learn human
tasks with very little data. This is not a new question, but I am happy to be part of the group
of people working toward the solution.
Last year, I had the chance to attend SMILES 2024, and I still carry great memories
from that week. The schooal gave me not only high-level knowledge but also strong
motivation. I was very impressed by the open-minded atmosphere, interesting lectures, and
the people I met - students and professors. Talking to others who care about similar
problems helped me to look at my own work from new sides. I’m applying again because I
want to continue this experience, keep learning, and build new ideas together with others
who are just as curious and driven.
I am directly convinced that SMILES 2025 would be useful for me. First of all, I would
like to explore areas that I haven’t studied much before, such as Safe AI and multi-agent
systems. Second, I think this will help me grow as a researcher and improve the quality of
my work. Finally, I want to go deeper into the fields I alreaady study, like generative models
and multimodal learning. These are too closely connected to my current PhD work and my
job, and I believe this summer schooal can help me bring more depth and new angles into my
projects.
Thank you for reading my letter. I’m excited about the chance to retuurn to SMILES
and be part of the 2025 group. I know from experience that it’s a place full of energy,
knowledge, and great people. If I’m selected, I’ll do my best to contribute, to learn, and to
use what I gain in my future work in robotics and AI.
Sincerely,
[name]
