Machine learning -- a powerful tool in many areas of our lives. Medicine is no
exception - it's a field with a wealth of data from a variety of sources that we
don't always understand. Diagnosis is a critical step in treatment, and machine
learning can help us significantly here. I spent a lot of time in hospitals and
clinics as a child because of my health, so I know firsthand about the problems
of misdiagnoses that arise due to the competence and experience of medical
professionals. Therefore, the creation of a tool capable of making the correct
diagnosis with a high degree of probability will be of great help to doctors.
In addition, my current activity is related to robotics (rehabilitation), where a
robot interacts with a complex system such as a human being. We widely use
machine learning methods in our work for motion planning, sensor information
processing, Reinforcement learning, sim-to-real and so on.
In the future I plan to develop in the field of medtech, create systems for
diagnostics, robots for operations and procedures, training simulators for
specialists
In SMILES I plan to learn the best practices for creating and working with good
neural networks, find out the non-obvious limitations of certain methods,
understand the current directions of machine learning (where it's all going and
what problems are in the way) and, of course, join the community of ML
enthusiasts and make useful acquaintance for possible future collaboration.
