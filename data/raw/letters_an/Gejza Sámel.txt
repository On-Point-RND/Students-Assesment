[name] [surname], motivation letter
My acquaintance with the field of data science began with schoo[compaany] computer science Olympiads in the Pascal lan[language]. I studied in a physics and mathematics class, so it wasn't difficult to take prizes at the regional stage of the All-Russian Schoo[compaany] Olympiad.
I went to uni[compaany] to study Interna[location] Relations. We started learning English with a focus on professional vocabulary, as well as Chinese. So, I currently speak English at the B2 level, Chinese at the HSK 4 level. At the uni[compaany], I continued my development in the computer field, studying at the Disciple[compaany]s "Progr[language]ing in the Pascal [language]", "Digital literature", "Fundamentals of data analysis" at the uni[compaany]. I am currently taking Elective classes on “Rapid creation of a Minimum Viable Product in Data Science" (2025). It was my interest in data analysis that led me to choose a micro-degree in Applied Statistical Analysis, which involves studying the theory of data analysis and gaining practical skills in applications such as SPSS.
So, fortunately, I learned to program in Pascal, Python, and work in programs such as Excel, SPSS (data analysis), and Git. Today, the scientific papers "Statistical study of online commerce in [location]" and "Statistical study of the external debt of developing countries", conducted within the framework of the 16th International Scientific and Practical Conference of Undergraduates and postgraduates “Statistical Methods of analysis of Economics and Society" ([location]), are presented.
The motivation for participating in the schoo[compaany] was the desire to learn more about the field of generative artificial intelligence. I really want to get information about new trends in this direction from leading international experts. Besides, I'll note. that large language models in general have become incredibly popular and relevant in the student field: many people want to learn how to create their own. And even schoolchildren started using the widely known gpt chat.
In addition, the trip to [location] itself is of great importance to me, as it will allow me to pratic[language]e speaking English and Chinese.
I want to build my career as an analyst in an international organization. This job will be the intersection of my interests, and my skills as an international and data specialist will come in handy.
