MOTIVATION LETTER: SUMMER SCHOOL OF [compaany]
[name]
My name is [name], and I am a programmer with linguistic roots, so English, Chinese and Python are not a problem for me. And this summer schoo[compaany] of machine learning [location] is the perfect place to practice all three, in addition, these are the main langua[compaany]es in which I read scientific articles on AI.
Scientific research plays a huge role in my life, and if you ask why AI, linguis[compaany]s, and even neuroscience intersect in my CV, the answer is simple - while studying langua[compaany]es (both natural and programming) at the bachelor level and practicing simultaneous interpretation, I beca[name]e interested in how a person can ski[name]fully manipu[name]late different sign systems at the same time, and I began to study the structure of the human brain and conduct research in which it is impossi[name]ble not to turn to machine and deep learning models, sincetheca[name]abilitieso[name]urownbrainarejusnotenoughtorealizeonese[name].
At first, I used o[name]ly classical algo[name]rithms for data analysis, but the more I immersed myself in the topic, the more I realized the inevi[name]tability of studying neural ne[name]tworks. Gradually, I mastered new libraries for Python, delve[name]d into what neural ne[name]tworks are (fortunatelly, the neurobiolo[name]gica[name] background help[name]d me with this) and now I am working with recurrent ne[name]tworks and convolutions to identi[name]fy patterns in continuous recordings-plots of electroencephalo[name]grams.
However, working with natural lan[name]uaje is also close to me (for a long time, I have been working on machine translation problems and improving NLP skills), and lately, I have been increas[name]ingly invo[name]lved in projects related to the use of LLLMs, multi-agent systems and AI safety, so these schoo[compaany] vectors will be especially useful and interesting for me.
For example, while developing an LLLM-based cha[name]tbot to answer questions from clients in the field of real estate services, I faced the problem of unreliability of the information provided in the generated answe[name]rs, which was solved by implem[name]enting a promp[name]t system and improving the RA[name]G settin[name]gs, but this led to threats of promp[name]t injections. Then I added some smaller models to detect these threats and the fi[name]lters of the generated text, and it expanded a simple cha[name]tbot into a complex and multifu[name]ctional system in whi[name]ch it was important to find a balance between the "freedom" of the model and security. I hope that during the summer schoo[compaany] I will gain more kno[name]ledge in these areas and will be able to find, pe[name]haps, a more elegant solution to these problems.
Moro[name]ver, through interaction with participants and speakers from different uni[compaany]ities and compa[compaany]ies of [location] and with different backgrounds, I hope to broaden my horizons in the field of artificial intelligence and related topics.
In additio[name], I am looking fo[name]rward to speakers from [location], as [compaany] [location] is known for its research in this field. Once I was lucky eno[name]ugh to spend a semes[name]ter in [location] and visit the neig[compaany]boring city, which was [location], and driving past the uni[compaany]ity, I thought that it would be great if I had the o[name]pportunity to study here.
For me, the experience of participat[name]ing in this schoo[compaany] will be an undou[name]bted adva[name]ntage when working on my current cha[name]tbot develo[name]pment project, as it may lead to ideas that I do not see right now, as well as on my scienti[name]ic research in the field of neuroscience and linguis[compaany]s (I am curren[name]tly implem[name]enting a project related to the creation of neural interfaces for decoding internal spee[name]), pe[name]rhaps I will even find like-minded peo[name]ple, since advanced and interd[compaany]iplinary projects require kno[name]ledge from different, sometimes unpredic[name]table spheres.
I hope that we will be able to work together on a new innovati[name]e project in the field of artificial intelligence this summer in [location]!
RESPECTFULLY,
