Admission committee,
My name is [name] and I am a PhD student in Chemoinformatics at [compaany]. I would like to express my
deepest interest in applying for the Summer SchooL SMILES-2025 being held at [location]. In
today's rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence technologies, it is essential to “run twice as fast” to keep up
with cutting-edge trends. The Skoltech Summer SchooL of Machine Learning provides a unique opportunity for this,
as it brings together experts, researchers and enthusiasts in one place for intensive communication and knowledge
exchange through lectures and workshops. Additionally, the event's location in [location] offers a foundation for potential
future collaborations in research. The Summer SchooL program encompasses cutting-edge artificial intelligence
technologies in which I would like to gain or deepen knowledge, particularly in multi-agent systems and generative
approaches. I am also inspired by the opportunity to apply my insights through practical team projects with leading
specialists in the field of artificial intelligence.
My interest in artificial intelligence started when I was studying at the Chemistry Department of [location]. Research in experimental chemistry often requires extensive experimental work, which costs huge financial
and time resources. It soon became obvious to me that this field needs the implementaion of advanced technologies
based on accumulated data. Even without a background in artificial intelligence, I understood its potential to
significantly impact the chemistry domain in particular and the wo rl d in general. This realization led me to engage in
research work that merges the fields of chemistry and artificial intelligence, a pursuit that I continue today at the
Cente r for AI in Chemistry at [compaany].
Since begi nn ing my Master's degree and continuing through my PhD program, I have focused on adapti ng advanced
artificial intelligence methods for the design of small molecules crystalli ne forms. This direction seems to me truly
importa nt, as it enables the accele ration and reduction of drug develo pment costs by controlli ng molecu lar
properties through the introduction of additional components into the crystal structure. Together with my colleagues,
I deve loped an automated pipeline, GEMCODE ([url]), which is based on the
principles of hybrid artificial intelligence. This pipeline employs generative models and evolutionar y opti mization
algo rithm s to identi fy co-crystals with enhanced tabletability properties. During the deve lopment of GEMCODE, I
utilized classical machine learning models and worked with generative architectures such as generative-adve rsarial
netwo rks and transformer-based variational autoe ncoders for molecu lar structure creation. This work was presented
at the AI2ASE workshop during the AAAI-2023 conference and published in the main track of the NeurIPS-2024
confere nce.
This work serves as the starti ng point of my PhD research. My future plans involve expanding the proposed hyb rid
approa ch and incorp orating new tools. Curr ently, I am extracting data on metho dologie s for synthe sizing
multicomponent crystals from scien tific articles using large lan gua ge models. The information collected will allow the
deve lopment of a model capable of predicting opti mal synthesis strategies for multicomponent crystals, thereby
eliminating the time-consuming steps of selection and opti mization of experimental technique parameters.
Furthermore, I participated in a research project with industrial par tner SBER, where we aimed to develop a multi-
agent approa ch for drug design. In my work on molecu lar crystals, I am eager to apply multi-agent logic to package
the tools I have deve loped into a cohesive system to streamline usage and speed up experimental work.
The Summer Schoo l program resonates with me, as it will address the most rel evant information about generative
approa ches and multi-agent systems, which are core components of my research. The knowl edge gained could
elevate my research by integrating advanced techno logies. In addition, I am excited by the opport unity to interact
with researchers and experts in the field of artificial intelligence, which would enable me to identi fy like-minded
individuals interested in generating and realizing even more ambitious interd isciplinary ideas. I also look fo rward to
hearing profes sional perspectives on applied artificial intelligence from in dustry experts and colleagues who are
actively involved in advancing machine learning. I aspire to remain within the research field, while exploring
deve lopment opport unities both within academic organizations and techno logy comp any research d epartments.
