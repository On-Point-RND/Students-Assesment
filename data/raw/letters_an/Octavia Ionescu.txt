Dear [name],
Artificial Intelligence is transforming how we interact with the world, and among its most exciting frontiers are multimodal and multi-agent systems. These technologies have the power to bridge modalities, languages, and even cultures. That’s precisely why I am thrilled to apply for the SMILES-2025 Summer School, with its emphasis on generative approaches, LLMs, and cross-border collaboration. The school’s multidisciplinary and international focus resonates deeply with both my academic path and my professional aspirations.
Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Behavioral Economics at [compaany], following a Bachelor's in Political Science from [compaany]. My transition from social sciences into AI was driven by a desire to better understand and shape decision-making processes—be they in individuals, organizations, or algorithms. I have since worked at the intersection of machine learning, cognitive science, and real-world applications.
My current research project, hosted by the [compaany], focuses on building a visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. This system aims to generate structured, cognitively accessible explanations of visual materials—like graphs and document layouts—tailored to user needs and domain specificity. We're combining document segmentation, multimodal reasoning, and generative models to build a VQA chatbot that delivers reliable and user-adaptive answers. This project touches directly on two core areas of SMILES-2025: multimodal methods and large language models, as it blends text-based language modeling with visual understanding and user feedback into an end-to-end generative pipeline.
My professional experience as a Data Scientist at [compaany] has given me hands-on exposure to applying machine learning in production. There, I’ve developed customer response models for various financial products, designed calibration tools for long-term LTV prediction, and optimized data pipelines to accelerate model development. Yet, what excites me most about ML is not just the technical puzzle, but the way models can evolve from abstract math into tools that genuinely help people—whether in banking, education, or healthcare.
Beyond my professional work, I’ve been actively involved in the hackathon circuit, which has become something of a proving ground for rapid innovation. In 2024 alone, I won first place at the [compaany] Hack Challenge (automating payment processing) and second place at [compaany] Hackathon (evaluating domain expertise from resumes). These experiences honed my ability to prototype quickly, collaborate with interdisciplinary teams, and communicate solutions clearly under pressure. They also sparked my deeper interest in natural language processing (NLP)—especially in adapting large language models for practical, high-stakes use cases.
NLP has become a particular focus of mine, and not only for its technical challenges. I’m fascinated by the way language models can mediate between people and data. My academic background gave me an appreciation for narrative, semantics, and communication across disciplines. Working with tools like [compaany], [compaany], and [compaany] in a multimodal context, I’ve realized that truly effective AI doesn’t just answer questions—it understands how to talk to people. And that’s where I want to contribute.
What makes SMILES-2025 especially exciting to me is its cross-cultural component. I’ve always been drawn to cultural studies. In school, I studied both [language] and [language]. In university, I added a third language and immersed myself in an English-speaking academic environment surrounded by international peers. Those years taught me to see the world through multiple lenses and appreciate the richness of diverse perspectives. The collaboration between [language] and [language] researchers is not just intellectually stimulating—it aligns with my belief that innovation happens best when people with different worldviews come together.
I see SMILES-2025 as more than a learning opportunity—it's a launchpad. I hope to deepen my understanding of large language models and multimodal systems, challenge my own ideas, and exchange insights with other passionate young researchers. These are the areas where I see the most exciting potential for real-world impact, especially as models become more capable of reasoning across text, vision, and user context. I'm particularly excited about sessions exploring generative architectures, cross-modal alignment, and how these systems can be made more adaptive, interactive, and human-aware.
Looking ahead, I aim to build a career at the intersection of research and product development, focused on intelligent systems that bridge vision and language in ways that are user-aware and contextually grounded. I believe the future of generative AI lies in personalization, interpretability, and collaboration between humans and machines. SMILES-2025 is a perfect step in that journey.
Thank you for considering my application. I’m looking forward to the possibility of contributing my skills and curiosity to this vibrant community—and to being inspired by others who are just as passionate about shaping the future of AI.
Warm regards,
