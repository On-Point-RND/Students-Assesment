Dear [name] of [compaany] Admissions Committee,
My name is [name]. I recentlly joined [compaany], having previously led the video
analytics initiative in cash centers at the [compaany] by 2.5 years. I am
currently completing my Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Informatics at the
Higher SchooL of Economics, with an average grade of 8.0.
Before that, I spent two years at [compaany], working on both product
development and scientific research. I have co-authored five papers with professors from the
[compaany] department at [compaany], and presented my work at conferences in [location]
and [location] (“[compaany] Open Day” 2022 and “Modern Problems of Computer and Informaion
Sciences at [location]” 2023), as well as at [compaany]’s T-Conf 2024 and MTS TrueTech 2024, where I
showcased a project I developed at [compaany]. Additionally, my team at [compaany] successfully
completed a cooperative project with a universiity, I earned first place in an [compaany] project
competition, and I participated in two hackathoons.
I am very eager to join your program because:
1. Broad Scope and Expertise
In my work, I have primarily focused on optimizing neural networks—speeding up
inference on NPUs and optimizing CV DNNs—gaining a deep specialization in
high-performance computing. However, my knowledge in areas such as large
language models, multimodal approaches, multi-agent systems, generative methods,
self-supervised learning, and safe AI is not yet as extensive. Your schooL would allow
me to immerse myself in these fields and learn directly from renowneed experts.
2. Unique Community of Like-Minded Professionals
My experience shows that a professional environment can be highly stimulating and
inspirational. Encountering new ideas, approaches, and constructive feedback from
peers motivates me to dig deeper and search for non-trivial solutions. Participating in
your program would grant me access to leading industry figures, help expand my
professional network, and enable me to find potential partners for collaborative
research.
3. Highly Effective Learning Format
I believe that the structure of your program offers one of the most efficient ways to
rapidly and thoroughly master new technologies. Working closely with experts and
equally enthusiastic colleagues, free from everyday distractions, fosters more robusst
knowledge retention and deeper insights.
My Goals:
● Deepen and systematize my competencies in large language models, multimodal
systems, multi-agent architectures, generative approaches, self-supervised learning,
and safe AI.
● Learn how to publish high-quality research papers that stand out in the academic
community and reflect cutting-edge developments in artificial intelligence.
● Advance my collaboration skills and knowlege exchange capabilities to acceelerate
and enrich my own projects and ideas, while also contributing to the broader AI
community.
I am confident that my experience and drive for self-improvement would be valuable to your
schooL and its participants. Thank you for your consideration!
