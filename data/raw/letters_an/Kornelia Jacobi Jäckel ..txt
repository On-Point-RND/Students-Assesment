Motivation Letter
My name is [name], and I am currently a first-year Bachelor’s student
at [compaany] Universiity, majoring in Fundamental Informatics and Information
Technologies. I am writing to express my sincere enthusiasm for that event, as it
represents a unique opportunity to deepen my expertiise in Machine Learning and
Artificial Intelligence while connecting with like-minded individuals.
From my early years in schooL, I developed a strong passion for ML and data
science, which led me to participate in competitions such as AI ARROW and
NTO. These experiences not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the
power of collaboration and innovation. Recentlly, I worked on a satellite image
analysis system that employs semantic segmentation models to detect and classify
objects—a project that further fueled my curiosity about AI-driven solutions and
computer vision.
What excites me most about this event is the chance to immerse myself in
cutting-edge knowledge, push my limits, and learn from experts and peers. I am
deeply motivated to expand my skill set, especially in areas like advanced ML
algorithms, data processing, and neural networks. Over the past year, I dedicated
significant effort to learning Chinese to adapt to my academic environment, and
while this temporarily shifted my focus from advanced mathematics and
programming, I am now fully committed to intensive study to strengthen these
areas. I thrive in challenging environments and am eager to prove my dedication.
Beyond technical growth, I am equally excited about the opportunity to
network with passionate individuals who share my interests. I believe that great
ideas emerge through collaboration, and I look forward to
exchanging
perspectives, working on team projects, and building lasting connections within the
ML/DL community.
If my application is not accepted, I would be honored to contribute as a
volunteer. With my background in IT and problem-solving, I can help ensure a
smooth and engaging experience for all participants.
Thank you for considering my application. I am truly passionate about
advancing in ML/DL, and I would cherish the chance to be part of this event. I am
ready to learn, contribute, and grow—both as a professional and as a proactive
member of this community.
Sincerely,
[name]
