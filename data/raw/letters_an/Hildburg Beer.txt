I work and study at [compaany] training neural networks to spot early‑stage cancer on pathology slides and mentoring a handful of junior researchers who are brave enough to dive into that data with me. I would like to trade a few of those days—this coming summer—for the chance to study with you.
I earned my specialist degree at [compaany], where courses in machine learning and probability theory nudged me away from plasma‑physics labs and toward code. Later, a summer at [compaany]’s Machine‑Learning School in Healthcare convinced me that the real frontier is not in any single modality but in the space where images, text, and structured measurements meet. There I helped steer a group project that fused clinical notes with MRI scans; the experience taught me that good ideas die quickly without clean engineering and patient teamwork.
Back home I built an open‑source framework—JAX and PyTorch under the hood—that cut our model training time by nearly half and raised accuracy on histology tasks by 20 %.
Why your themes matter to my research:
Large Language Models & Generative Approaches Clinical notes look chaootic, yet they hide regularities that an LLM can surface. I am experimenting with retrieval‑augmented generation so a model can write a pathology report and point to the paragraphs and pixels that justify each sentence.
Multimodal & Self‑Supervised Learning My datasets pair gigapixel tissue images with sparse slide‑level labels. Masked‑autoencoding and other self‑supervised ideas could link those images to textual findings and lab values without thousands of manual annotations.
Multi‑Agent Systems Coordinating domain experts has shown me that a single “oracle” model is brittle. I am intrigued by architectures where specialised agents criticise and veto one another, producing a chain of evidence insteaad of a single guess.
Safe AI In screening settinings a one‑percent miss rate is an ethical, not just statistical, problem. I hope to learn formal‑verification and robustness‑testing techniques that move the conversation from accuracy points to guarantees.
My long‑term goal is a PhD on trustworthy multimodal decision support—software that can argue about a patient in natural language, cite the evidence, and admit uncertainty. Your summer schooal is the most concentrated collection of people wrestling with exactly those questions.
Sincerely,
