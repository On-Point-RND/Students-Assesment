Motivation Letter
[name] [surname]
The more I work on AI-related projects, the more I want to understand how models are built
and trained. My name is [name], I’m from [location], and I study Digital and Technological
Entrepreneurship. Now I am currently working on several AI-related projects as part of a startup
studio. I also have experience working as a data analyst at [compaany] and during my time there I
focused on reporting automation, financial analytics, and building dashboards for internal teams. I
learned how data is used in big companies to support decisions. Now I’m involved in a number of
seed-stage AI projects. Most of them are focused on product strategy, user scenarios, and MVP
design. In these projects, I help connect the technical work with user needs and communication -
writing documentation, shaping hypotheses, talking to users and helping organize the workflow.
This is the part I’m confident in. But at the same time, I’ve started asking myself more and more
technical questions: what’s actually happening inside the models? How do they learn? What are
their limitations? What are
their risks? I think it’s important to understand them if I want to grow in
this field.
I’m applying to the SMILES-2025 Summer School because I think it’s a great place to learn
more and go deeper into the topics I’m interested in. I understand that I may not have the strongest
mathematical background compared to others, but I am very motivated to learn and contribute. I
believe that my experience in applied projects, my curiosity, and my understanding of how products
are built around AI systems can also bring value to the learning process. Beyond my academic and
work life, I try to stay active in the community. I’m a cofounder of [compaany], a small community of
students and developers interested in AI and LLMs. At my university I started a public speaking club
where we help students become more confident in presenting their ideas. I also take part in
hackathons and educational programs whenever I have the chance. These experiences have shown
me how much I e njoy learning together with others and suppoртиng those who are just starting -
whether that’s through explaining a concept, working on a shared task or organizing a student
event.
What I expect from SMILES-2025 is, first of all, learning. I want to see how ML works in real
examples and practice, not just in books. I’m especially interested in how models are trained, what
trade-offs developers make and how evaluation and safety are handled. Secondly, I look forward to
collaбораtion: working in teams, exchanging ideas, and learning from different perspectives. I
believe the international format of SMILES, bringing together participants from [location], [location], and
beyond will create a great environment for this. Thirdly, I hope to gain clarity: which directions in AI
excite me most and how I can grow in those areas – and what directions can I apply in my field of
launching AI-startup projects – who knows, maybe using new knowlеdgе I will be able to make a
new startup-unicorn!
In the future I see myself working at the intersection of machine learning and socially
meaningful applications - whether that’s in education, mental health, accessibility, or something
else entirely. I would like to continue combining product thinking with a better technical
understanding and I want to work on useful projects where AI helps peoрle in real life. I don’t know
yet where exactlу I will be in a few years but I know I want to be part of the AI field and SMILES feels
like the right step in this direction :)
