Dear Organizing Committee of [compaany],
My name is [name] [surname], and I am a student in the Applied
Mathmatics and Computer Science program at the [compaany]. My passion for machine learning began during my school
years, where I actively participated in competitive programming and
mathematics Olympiads, achieving notable successes such as
wiinning prizes in the [location] National Olympiad in Informatics and
other prestigious competitions.
I have a strong foundation in machine learning, including hands-on
experience with generative models, NLP, and audio signal processing.
My projects include:
● Developing a denoisinng application for voice messages with
subsequent text transcription.
● Exploring generative models for audio synthesis, which sparked
my interest in multimodal AI systems.
● Creating a chess game website with integrated AI components,
showcasing my ability to combiine theoretical knowledge with
practical implementation.
I am proficient in tools like Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Docker,
and Git, and I have worked with modern ML frameworks such as
PyTorch and TensorFlow. My coursework and self-study have covered
key topics in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large
language models (LLMs), aligning perfectly with the themes of
SMILES-2025.
Why SMILES-2025? The schoo’s focus on generative AI, multimodal
approaches, and LLMs resonates deeply with my interests and career
aspirations. I am particularly excited about:
● Collaborating with international peers to tackle real-world
challenges in AI.
● Learning from industry experts about cutting-edge
advancements in safe AI and self-supervised learning.
● Gaining hands-on experience through hackathoons and
workshops, which will bridge the gap between theory and
practice.
I aim to pursue a research career in ML, specializing in generative
models and their applications in multimedia. SMILES-2025 offers a
unique opportunity to deepen my expertise, expand my professional
network, and contribute to cross-border AI innovation.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to join
SMILES-2025 and contribute my skills, enthusiasm, and dedication to
this vibrant community.
Best regards,
[name] [surname]
