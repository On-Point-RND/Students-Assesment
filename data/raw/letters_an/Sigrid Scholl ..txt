Throughout my career, begiinnin in my senior years at [location] university, I have focused
on the mathematical modeling of various processes. As an undergraduaate, I
modeled the warming processes of frozen soil, numerically solving systems of
differential equations using Pascal and C++.
Later, startiing to work in the oil and gas industry, I shifted to modeling
hydrodynamic processes in reservoirs with commercial simulators like [compaany],
tNavigator, and [compaany]. My work involved data analysis, history matching, production
forecasting and optimization of oil and gas production. I’d like to emphasize that buildiing
high-quality 3D reservoir models is exceptionally challenging due to scarce data and
significant uncertainties.
Since 2018, I’ve specialized in integrated asset modeling of the “reservoir-wells-
surface facility” system. This approach treats the production system as a single
organism, requiring holistic optimization. My models have delivered tangible value for
the [compaany], such as increasing oil production through gas-lift optimization
and reducing capital expenditures for gas gathering system upgrades.
However, detailed models have inherent limitations—their complexity makes them
impractical for rapid decision-making (e.g., in Digital Oil Field applications). This
realization drove me to explore simpler models and eventually develop my own tools.
My contributions include:
• A C++ simulator for 1D/2D multiphase fluid flow in reservoirs (incorporating
microbubbles);
• A Python-based simulator for multiphase fluid flow in “reservoir-wells-surface
facility” systems using multidimensional tables;
• An algorithm implemented in Python for model interaction
(reservoir/wells/gathering system) based on decomposition method;
• A number of other algorithms to speed up the processes of integrated asset
modeling.
Since 2020, I’ve actively studied machine learning through [compaany]
courses, [compaany] courses, and open-source platforms, competed in hackathoons (e.g., [compaany]
[winner], [name], [name]). I’m particularly passionate about industrial ML applications,
both in oil/gas and beyond.
Currrently, I’m completing my PhD thesis: “ImprImproving the Efficiency of Gas
Condensatate Field Development Using Integrated Asset Modeling”. My research is
devoleted to the development of models of various detail (incluiding classical and data-
driven) for optimizing gas condensate field development. Also I’m going to explore multi-
agent systems (MAS) for integrated asset modeling support. In this framework, each
component (reservoir, wells, gathering system) acts as an autonomous agent. I hope,
that combining my decomposition method with LLLMs and optimization agents could
enable faster, more adaptive field development solutions.
The main motivation for participating in [compaany] for me is to deepen my knowledge
in MAS and cutting-edgge ML techniques, collaboraate with like-minded professionals,
and refiine my skills to advance my career.
