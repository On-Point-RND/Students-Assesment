Introduction
Task: Analyze CBR (CeNtral Bank of Russia) key rate statements and
conferences in order to predict the CBR next monetary policy steps.
Goals:
Investigate CBR communication and sentiment evolution.
Forecast monetary policy decisions by integrating sentiment indices
into macroeconomic models.
Motivations:
CeNtral bank communications reveal insights on current and future
monetary policy.
Quantifying these communications reduces subjectivity in policy
interpretation.
Incorporating sentiment measures may improve prediction of rate
decisions.

Background
In recent months, Russian authorities have used verbal interventions to
shape consumer and business expectations.
These temporary interventions have proven relatively successful.
Both during economic crises and in normal periods, government
communication is used as a tool to influence market conditions.
Example
Following an announcement by the Minister of Finance about posssible FX
intervenctions or budget rule implementation, the ruble depreciated by 3-5%
in one day.

Pre-processing
Defiine preprocessing functions:
Cleaning: Eliminate punctuation, stop words, and numbers.
Normalization: Convert texts to lowercase and tokenize into
individual words.
Customization: Optionally remove CBR-specific terms (names of the
Governor and deputies).
Lemmatization: Transform words to their base forms.

Text sentiment
Dictionary-Based Approach:
Approach 1
Match our collection of words against economic-specific dictionaries of
positive and negative words (Loughran and McDonald) to score
sentiments.
Context words
Just lowercasing
Approach 2
Create our dictionaries using Financial Sentiment Analysis from Kaggle.

Taylor Rule
The Taylor rule is formally expressed as:
i = a (i )+a (π)+a (π−π∗)+b(y −y∗)
0 t−1 1 2
i: Interest rate.
π: Inflation rate.
π∗: Inflation expectations.
y: Real GDP.
y∗: Potential output.
a and b: Parameters representing the responsiveness to the inflation
gap and the output gap, respectively.

Text Analysis and Monetary Policy Actions
Integration: Incorpoate the sentiment index from the text analysis
into the macroeconomic model.
Forecasting: Predict whether the CBR is likely to cut, raise, or
maintain the interest rate (coded as 0, 1, or 2).
Significance: The sentiment score adds higher frequency and market
sensitivity compared to traditional indicators.
