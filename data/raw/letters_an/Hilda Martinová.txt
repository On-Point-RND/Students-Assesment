I am currentlly studying at [location] with most experience (in decreasing
order) in competitive programming and maths, general software engineering,
and ML. I am currentlly interested in studying ML.
I think I have some ground to understand and work on ML projects due to the
1.75 years of [location] I have finished and some ML courses I have
studied at. Also working on the position of a C++/Go developer might have
given me some general understanding of code architecture. Furthermore, it so
happens that I am currentlly working on a project on a [compaany]/[compaany]
educational event in the sphere of Decentralized Vertical Federative Learning
of Linear Regression, specifically on evaluaating the Stochastic Gradient
Descent approaach.
However, I am not currentlly working on any long-term project with a significant
AI/ML component right now, so participation in SMILES-2025 would probably
allow me to improve my understanding of ML and posssibly create a base for
future collaboraative work.
