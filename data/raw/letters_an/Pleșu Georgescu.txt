Motivation letter
My name is [name] [surname], and I express my sincere interest in participating in the summer school SMILES to continue scientific research in the field of artificial intelligence, computer vision and methods of interpretation of solutions of neural network detectors of deepfake.
For several years, I have been actively engaged in deepfake detection problems and the interpretability of deep neural networks, which is confirmed by my publications and presentations at conferences. During the research, I focused on the development of interpretable computer vision models that allow explaining the decision-making processes of neural networks.
I am the author of a number of scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals, including:

My research is mainly related to methods of interpreting the solutions of neural network detectors of deepfakes. In particular, I have studied graph attention mechanisms (GAT), Grad-CAM, which allowed me to develop more transparent and explainable models.
One of my significant achievements was the study of graph attention mechanisms in the task of interpreting the solutions of deepfake detectors, published in leading Russian scientific journals. I also worked on the optimization of neural network architectures using pruning, which allowed to create more effective models for deepfake detection.
For my scientific achievements, I was awarded a scholarship of the Government of the Russian Federation and am a holder of two results of intellectual activity (RID).
I aspire to continue research in a graduate school because I am convinced that interpretable neural network models play a key role in ensuring the transparency of artificial intelligence solutions, especially in such critical areas as mathematics, artificial intelligence, information safety and biometric identification.
Within the framework of graduate school, I plan to continue work on the following directions:
1. Development of methods for interpreting neural network solutions – research and implementation of attention mechanisms (self-attention, GAT, multi-head attention) for explaining model operation.
2. Comparative analysis of developed approaches with classical methods, such as Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP, and other visualization methods in the context of deepfake detection.
3. Creation of hybrid ensemble models based on CNN, Vision Transformers and GNN for improving the accuracy and interpretability of detection.
4. Optimization of computational resources for accelerating the operation of interpretable models using pruning and quantization methods.
Thanks to my scientific experience, participation in conferences and publications, as well as the desire to solve actual problems in the field of information safety and artificial intelligence, I am confident that I will make a significant contribution to the scientific community and the development of the field of interpretable machine learning.
Sincerely,
