Motivation letter
My name is [name], and I am convinced that machine learning is more than a tool, it is a language for understanding the world using data.
I am currently studying mathematical physics (in particular geometry) at [location], where I immerse myself in abstractions.
Nevertheless, I see for myself that my goal is to combine complex mathematical concepts with real-world tasks, from medical diagnostics to topological data analysis. Your program is an ideal platform for converting rigorous mathematical theory into efficient algorithms (new machine learning models), and I want to build long-term and collaborative scientific contacts with your community, and acquire important modern knowledge and skills. My main goal is to make a breakthrough in the study of the technology of artificial intelligence as a new modern theory with fantastic possibilities for implementation in life.
This can be compared to the history of quantum mechanics, when theoretical concepts of how the world works on a very small scale led to the emergence of lasers, sensors, and smartphones.
Why ML? The path from equations to results
This curiosity led me to projects where abstract mathematics meets real-world applications.:
1. Teaching undergraduates the language of mathematics
At [compaany], I developed a set of questions for learning how to work with large language models (LLM) in computational mathematics and computer algebra. The task was not only to introduce equations, but also to instill logical thinking â€” to explain why some numerical methods converge and others diverge, or how integration surpasses symbolic manipulation. This experience has taught me how to structure knowledge for machines in such a way that it reflects human problem solving, paying special attention to stability analysis and algorithmic complexity.
2. Medical Imaging Revolution at the AIRI Hackathon
During the ARISE-2025 hackathon, my team developed a comprehensive solution for automated rheumatoid arthritis assessment. I proposed a hybrid architecture combining Vision Transformers (for global models) and EfficientNet (for local functions). To improve accuracy, we implemented progressive learning, gradually increasing the image resolution, which reduced the average absolute error (MAE) by 22%. By optimizing logical inference using TensorRT, we increased the prediction speed by 1.8 times. However, the most useful aspect was to enable clinicians to interpret the results using Grad-CAM and SHAP visualizations. This highlighted the irreplaceable value of interpretability of models in healthcare, a principle that I now apply in every project.
3. Minimal spanning trees:
In my study of the asymptotic behavior of minimum spanning trees (MST), I investigated their application in topological data analysis (TDA). For example, MST-based edge length distributions can detect minor shifts in single-cell genomic data sets, revealing clusters invisible by traditional methods. This work, which combines stochastic geometry with ML, has strengthened my belief that even the most abstract mathematical theories can provide practical tools for bioinformatics and beyond.
I am technically proficient in Python, C++, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, and have also recently studied diffusion models and Schrodinger bridges. Apart from tools, my strong point lies in analyzing the mathematical basis of algorithms. For example, when setting up hyperparameters, I analyze how the choice of learning rate affects the stability of gradient descent, instead of relying on a brute-force grid search.
