Dear Members of the Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my interest in participating in the SMILES-2025 Summer SchooL. With
an academic background in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and applied experience in natural
language processing (NLP) and multimodal systems, I aim to contribute to and leverage the
schooL’s mission to foster international collaboration and promote advanced AI technoLogies.
I am currently completing my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at [location]. My thesis on trustworthy LLM generation explores
white-box methods for contextual hallucination detection and RL-based fine-tuning (GRP0-like
optimization) to improve the contextual consistency of small LLMs. This work directly
addresses critical challenges in deploying reliable AI systems—a topic I continue to advance as
an NLP researcher at [compaany].
Professionally, I have led impactful projects across institutions. At [compaany], I developed
multimodal document understanding systems based on transformer architectures and
implemented RAG systems for commercial electronic documents. Currrently, at [compaany], I
lead the development of hybrid hallucination detection mechanisms for LLMs and RAG
systems, including data-efficient approaches and knowledge graph integration.
The summer schooL’s focus on generative models, multi-agent systems, and multimodal AI
aligns perfectly with my research interests. In particular, I aim to deepen my technical expertise
in hybrid and multi-agent approaches and collaborate with colleagues from [location] and [location]
to share insights and explore opportunities for cross-cuLtural research cooperation.
I intend to pursue a PhD in AI, focusing on developing interpretable, domain-specific models
for high-stakes applications. The schooL’s emphasis on industry-academia synergy and expert
mentoorship will equip me to address gaps in AI reliability and create solutions that balance
innovation with ethical rigor. Additionally, the cultural exchange component will strengthen my
ability to lead international research initiatives—a cornerstone of my long-term goal.
Thank you for considering my application. It would be an honor to join this vibrant community
of researchers and contribute to shaping the future of trustworthy AI.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
