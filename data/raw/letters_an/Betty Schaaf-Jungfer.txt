Dear [name],
My name is [name], and I am deeply enthusiastic to submit my application for
the SMILES Summer School of machine learning.
I have a double degree from [location] and the Higher School of Economics ([compaany]), I work with medical
data as a data scientist at [compaany], and I've had the chance to teach and learn at some
top [compaany], but I still feel like there’s a lot I haven’t tried, and a lot I’m
hoping to change in myself.
One of the main reasons I want to join SMILES is personal. Lately, I’ve been
growing aware of how much my comfort zone is centered on quiet, solo work. I
know that science is a team effort, and I see how my own anxiety sometimes gets
in the way of speaking up, asking questions, or connecting with peers about
difficult topics. I want to break free from that a bit (or to try at least)—not just to
be a better worker, but to be more open and confident in myself. This summer
school, with its mix of new faces and hard technical topics, feels like the perfect
place for me to practice and grow.
Professionally, I think SMILES would let me step away from my usual rush of
deadlines and practical deliverables and let me focus again on deeper, more
research-driven work. As I prepare to apply for a master’s degree this year, I want
to reconnect with the excitement and curiosity that actually got me into data
science to begin with: the medical projects I work on now are fast-moving and
real-world, but I often miss the space to think, experiment. Additionally, I am
driven by a desire to refine the skills I’ve recently developed through practice.
“Practice makes progress” they say;
My experience in machine learning covers a range of things (some are presented
in my CV): from building data pipelines and engineering solutions to deploying
classifiers and working with real medical data at [compaany] now. I started out as a
Teaching Assistant in statistics at [compaany], spent some time as a trading intern.
Recently, I’ve been fascinated by the internals of large language models—
especially after reading Anthropic's “On the Biology of a Large Language Model”
series. I try to keep up with the latest research and challenge myself to understand
how these models actually work, not just how to use them. I have that FOMO
thing (“fear of missing out”) about endless new ideas and concepts, and I love the
chance to discuss and debate with people who feel the same.
I’m especially eager to see sessions on Multi-Agent Systems or Safe/Consistent/
Reliable AI. The hype around agents makes me curious, but what I want most is
to understand how to make AI reliable, especially since unpredictability in large
models is a real issue in my daily work in the medical field.
Looking ahead, I want this summer school to fuel my drive, both as a signal to future master’s programs (at places like [location], [location], [location]…). Any new
experience helps, I think SMILES could be a turning point for me: academically ,
professionally, and personally.
Thank you for considering my application. I hope you’ll give me the opportunity
to join, learn, struggle, and grow together with everyone at SMILES — whether
it’s in [location] or online.
Regards,
[name]
