Dear Organizing Committee,
I am writing to express my interest in participating in the summer schoo lSMILES-2025.
I’ve a lways been fascinated by how machine learning algo rithm s can autonomou sly extract
meanin gful patterns from raw data to solve real-wor ld problems. A notable example from research
literature demo nstrates how deep neural ne tworks processing high-dimensional mass
spectrometry data for medical diagnostics develop disti nct hierarchi cal representations. Through
dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or UMAP, we can observe how intermediate layers
of these ne tworks form separable clusters in latent space, each correspondi ng to specific
pathological conditions or biomarkers. Inspired by such approa ches, we succe ssfully applied
repre sentation learning with contrasti ve loss for zero-shot analysis of spectroscopic data, which
led to a published paper.
Curr ently at the Insti tute of Organic Chemistry [location], I work at the inte rsection of chemis try and
machine learning. Beyond developing classical ML and DL models for specific tasks, I'm
addre ssing the need for LLM-based agent systems that combi ne textual analysis and reasoning
capabilities with external tools. These tools prove essen tial for chemis try-speci fic applications,
situations requiring precise rather than probabilistic answe rs, and tasks demanding up-to-date
knowl edge.
I am developing a framework that integrates an LLM-powered agent with specialized tools and
RAG capabilities - particularly crucial in scienti fic research where new specialized knowl edge
emerges consta ntly. To better adapt lan gua ge models to our c hemi cal domain, I am imple menting
LoRA fine-tuning, which allows efficient specialization while preserving the model's general
capabilities. The inhere ntly multimodal nature of c hemi cal data (text, images, graph-based
structures and physicochemi cal measu rements) further neces sitates developing specialized
encoders for each data modality. This combi nation of techniques - LLM agents, multimodal
learning, and parameter-efficient adaptation - is exa ctl y why this summer schoo l's focus on
cutting-e dg e ML approa ches resonates stro ngly with my work.
This summer schoo l immediat ely caught my attention because it covers exa ctl y what I want to
work on right now - the latest deve lopments in AI, from mas si ve lan gua ge models to systems that
combi ne different data types and multiple intelligent agents working together. What I really like is
how the program doesn't just talk about theory but actually shows how to solve real-wor ld indus try
challenges. That practical focus is exa ctl y what I need to develop my skills as some one who wants to
build useful tech solutions. Learning dir ectly from top AI experts and being part of Harbin
Insti tute of Technology’s reno wned academic enviro nment (a global leader in computer science!)
feels like an unbeatable oppo rtunity to level up my knowl edge.
Equally inspiring is the chance to conne ct with a community of driven peers. Colla borating with
talented researchers, sharing ideas, and buildi ng profes sional relationships could open doors not
just for my current projects, but for my long-term career. As I am at an early stage in my career,
excelling in this program will enable me to take on greater r esponsibilities and pursue more
impa ctful initia tives in the future. I’m ready to dive in, learn, and contribute to the kind of inn ovative
work that moves AI fo rward.
Sincer ely,
