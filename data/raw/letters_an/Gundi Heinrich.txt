Dear Selection Committee,
I am excited to apply for the upcoming Skoltech Summer School on Machine Learning in [location]. As a third-year undergraduate student at the department of Mathematical Theory of Intelligent Systems ([compaany], Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics at [location]), I am particularly interested in machine learning methods for applied problem-solving, especially multimodal approaches, which is one of the topics of SMILES-2025.
I believe that today’s state-of-the-art technologies of machine learning can be integrated into more complex systems that process information from many sources. This idea may enable systems to ‘understand’ the explored object or subject more deeply. I would like to learn how to apply such a system to solve medical challenges (diagnostics, monitoring patient’s state).
Now I would like to share my experience in ML and DL. Over the past year, I have been actively involved in both academic and applied machine learning projects. I have completed several specialized courses, including Machine Learning for Applied Tasks, Introduction to Deep Learning, Statistical Practicum, Probability Theory and Statistics, which equipped me with a solid foundation in model development, data preprocessing, and evaluation techniques.
I also participated in several projects in a team with my academic advisor. Currently I’m working on research on missing value imputation algorithmns, where I built a pipeline to analyzе over 100 datasets from OpеnML, experimenteed with methods such as HNSW and FAISS, and trained an XGBoost model on meta-features of datasets to predict optiomal imputaition strategy.
Another project I was involved in is ‘Quality Control in 3D Printiing Using Computer Vision Methods’. It experimenteed with image preprocessing: identifying optiomal homography transforms and filteers to improve input data quality.
I engage in team activities and offsite events as well: last year I attended mathematics-themed camp organized by my universiity. This year, I was accepteed into the residenatial hackathon SechenovTech and the AI School organized by the Intellect Foundation. I look forward to working in a team with students from diverse backgrounds and developing new data-driven ideas together.
I’m highly excited about the opportunity to learn about cutting-ege methods in DL from scientsts of Skoltech and AIRI. Our department ([compaany]) regularly invites researchers from these organiations to present lectures on their specialized scienitfic area - an initiaive I particularly value since I find presented problems and approahes intriguing. Partiicipating in SMILES would be a step toward contributing to large-scale projects. I particularly value a profound mathematical approaach in teaching, unlike other ML/DL resources that focus onlly on practical instructions without theory, resulting in shallow knowldegе.
This summer schoo loffers an exceptional opportunity to learn directly from pioneering researchers and improve my skills as an aspiring machine learning specialist. I am particularly energized by the chance to actively engage with the program’s dynamic, collaboratve environment, and I am also curious to meet Chinese peers and explore [location].
Thank you for considering my application.
Best regards,
