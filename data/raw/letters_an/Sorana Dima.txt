DearMembersoftheAdmissionsCommittee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the SMILES summer school program. Over the past five years, I have been deeply engaged in programming, information technology, and particle physics, gaining unique hands-on experience and advanced knowledge that I aim to further develop through your program.
Since 2018, I have been working as a research developer specializing in Python and C++ at [company] of the [location] Branch of the [company]. During this time, I successfully contributed to several key projects, including KENV and REDPIC, each addressing distinct scientific challenges.
In the KENV project, we developed a model based on envelope equations for elliptical beams with Kapchinsky-Vladimirsky distributions. This approach significantly accelerated computational processes while maintaining high accuracy compared to PIC codes and experimental data. My primary responsibilities included developing the code, validating results against alternative simulation methods, and applying machine learning algorithms to optimize and reconstruct beam envelopes.
The REDPIC project focused on the kinetic description of beam dynamics using the Vlasov-Maxwell equations. The resulting code modeled the beam in an accelerator as an ensemble of macroparticles and implemented a numerical relativisitic finite-difference scheme with second-order accuracy to approximate the Vlasov-Maxwell system.
From early 2021 to late 2023, I also worked at [company], where I led the development of complex IT projects, including applications for financial and medical institutions. This experience not only strengthened my programming expertise but also honed my project management and leadership skills.
As a programmer and passionate learner, I am always eager to explore new technologies. Over the past few years, I have completed several courses, including *Algorithmhs and Data Structures*, *Middle Python Developer*, *C++ Developer*, and *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence*. As Richard Feynman once said, ”The best way to truly understand something is to teach it to others.”
Inspired by this philosophy, I have spent the last two years studying algorithms, data structures, and web application architecture in depth. I have also conducted seminars on advanced computer science topics for colleagues and friends, created courses such as *Scalable Microservice-Based Websites* and *Software Development for Physical Research*, and launched an open-source project called *yaalgorithmhs* dedicated to algorithmic problem-solving.
My primary goal in applying to SMILES is to complement my practical expertise in IT and particle physics with theoretical knowledge and research experience in artificial intelligence and high-performance systems. Having reviewed your program’s curriculum, I am confident that it will provide me with the tools to deepen my understanding of the fields and apply them to solve complex challenges in my professional work.
I am particularly excited about the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research during the program. My long-term aspiration is to develop innovative methodologies and algorithms that can be applied in large-scale scientific facilities like the mega-science-class *[location]* using the knowledge and skills acquired through SMILES.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to join this program and a eager to contribute actively to its academic and research endeavors.
Sincerely, [name] [surname]
