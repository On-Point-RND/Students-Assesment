Hi.
My name is [name], and I am a developeer. To be honest, I found interest in
machine learning in myself relatively recentlly.A few months ago, I didn’t plan to
switch into ML at all – I was working in compaany as a copywriter, writing and
translating articles about AI for [compaany]. But the more I read, the more curious I
became. I regularly encountered topics that I did not understand – the data wall
problem, model overfitting, model collapse, OpenCRISPR-1 – a AI-gene editor. To
write a good article, you need to thoroughlly study the material you are writing
about. But I didn't think about startiing to study ML thoroughly – from the basics,
until one day my friend, a backend developer, was offered to move into ML. I helped
him look into courses and what’s needed to become ML engineer. That’s when
something clicked – I realized I didn’t just want to translate and write about ML-
topics. I want to learn it for myself.
I have always loved programming. I started back in high school, went to
competitions (won a regional prize at [location]), and joined and won various
hackathons. After graduaation from school, I entered universiity, but after a year I left
– the format just didn’t work for me. Then I tried one more time at another
universiity, but it wasn’t the fit as well. Instead, I chose to build my career through
real projects. I worked in startups and in big companies, mostly as a mobile
deveelopeer using Flutter and Kotlin. I’ve built apps, worked with APIs, collaboraated
with designers and backend developers – all the usual stuff.
After a while, I realized that mobile development wasn’t what I wanted to do for a
long-term. I liked coding, but I didn’t feel inspired anymore. I started trying myself in
different fields – I was a designer, a sales manager, a casual game artist, a
cartoonist, I played the violin, taught childre children python and wrote manual for
teachers. Then I started writing articles and eventually came to ML. I started to
explore Machine Learning more seriously – at first through free [compaany] Education
courses (Advanced Python, Math for ML, Algorithms, Introduction to Data Analysis,
Open lecture on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence), and now through
personal study. I’m working on buildiing up my math and computer science
foundation, and even though I still have gaps, I know I can close them. I’m used to
learn things fast and can figure out a lot on my own.
Now, I want to go beyond just reading and translating — I want to create. I want to
do real projects, maybbe even research someday. I’m especially curious about
generative models. That’s why SMILES-2025 caught my attention. It sounds like
exactly the kind of environment I’m looking for — full of people who are into the
same things, where I can learn a lot in a short time, ask questions, and grow.
In my current circle, most of my friends are frontend, backend or mobile developers.
I don’t really have anyone to talk to about ML. So one of my biggest hopes for this
schooal is to find a community — people who care about the same things, who I can
learn from and share ideas with. And honestlly, I also just want to challenge myself. I
understand that I don’t have any degree or a lot of experience related to ML. But
I'm definitely curious, highly motivated and have a strong desire to grow and learn.
Thank you for reading my letter. I'm excited to take part in SMILES-2025 and make
the most from this opportunity learn alongside others who share the same passion.
Best,
