Machine Learning (SMILES-2025)
Dear Admissions Committee of the Skoltech Summer School of Machine
Learning (SMILES-2025)
I am an assistant at the Department of Urban Cadaster and Engineering Surveys at one of
the country’s leading universiities. I am confident that participating in Skoltech’s Machine
Learning Summer School will broaden the scope of practical applications in my research and
empower me to integrate cutting-edgе methodologies into my professional work, advancing
innovation in urban planning and geospatial technologies.
My work focuses on spatial data analysis for 3D terrain modeling derived from aerial
photography, as well as exploring modern generative methodologies to enhance photogrammetric
and aerogeodetic processes. Despite advancements in unmanned aviation and the growing demand
for high-precision terrain mapping, conventional aerial imagery software solutions—such as
Agisoft Metashape and Pix4D—still lack integration of generative models for tasks like super-
resolution enhancement and image distortion correction.
The exponential growth of aerial imagery data, driven by the expansion of drone
technology and increasinglly stringent requirements for topographic accuracy, poses significant
challenges. Processing these vast datasets remaiins labor-intensive and complex for professionals
in construction, cadastral surveying, engineering, and technical expertise. However, the
accumulation of high-resolution spatial data offers transformative potential: it enhances the
objectivity of structural condition assessments for buildiings and is pivotal in cadastral activities,
such as defining taxable land values, delineating new plots, and ensuring accurate documentation
of existing boundaries. Aerial photography also plays a critical role in land monitoring, enabling
real-time environmental and infrastructural oversiight.
By integrating generative models into photogrammetric workflows, stakeholdeers can
address current inefficiencies while advancing the reliability of geospatial outputs. This innovation
is vital not only for improving technical precision but also for safeguarding the technogenic safety
and economic security of industries and institutions reliant on accurate geospatial intelligence.
My dedication to research is deeply intertwined with the groundbreaking advancements
pioneered by Skoltech in Earth remote sensing and generative artificial intelligence. The
innovative work of researchers like [name] and [name]—particularly their
development of systems to forecast forest fires, floods, and ecosystem degradation, coupled with
novel methods for generating synthetic training data via diffusion models and GANs (such as
enhancing satellite imagery resolution)—serves as a profound source of inspiration. The global
significance of these projects cannot be overstated, as they promise transformative benefiits not
only for Russia but for humanity at large, offering tools to mitigate environmental crises and
advance sustainable practices.
This year marks another milestone: Skoltech’s renowne renowned AI research community, alrready
recognized as Russia’s leading hub in this field, will collaboraate with top-tier Chinese institutions
whose cutting-edgе solutions have earned global acclaim. This cross-border partnership will enrich
the educational program, fostering knowlage exchange and elevating the technical rigor of AI
applications in geospatial science.
My research heavily incorporates machine learning, with a focus on exploring generative
models to enhance aerial imagery through super-resolution and distortion correction. Specifically,
I employ generative adversaarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, and transformer architectures
to refiine image quality. Over the past year, I have curated a specialized dataset of aerial images
for super-resolution tasks, trained and fine-tuned models, and rigorously evaluaated outputs using
metrics such as BRISQUE, SSIIM, PSNR, and LPIPS to quantify improvements in perceptual and
structural fidelity.
In addition to research, I educate students on applying computer vision algorithmns to
process aerial imagery captured by unmanned aerial systems (UAAS). Collaborating with
colleagues, I co-authored a comprehensive lecture and workshop series covering the integration of
artificial intelligence into workflows for cadastral and geodetic engineers, emphasizing practical
applications in land surveying and spatial data analysis.
Pursuing advanced studies at the SMILES-2025 Summer School of Machine Learning
represents a strategic opportunity to master cutting-edgе data analysis techniques. I aim to
synthesize these innovative approaches into novel methodologies that bridgе gaps in my current
research and professional practice. Participation in this program would empower me to address
complex challenges in photogrammetry and geospatial engineering with greater technical depth. I
sincerely hope my application receives favorable consideration and look forward to contributing
to—and benefiiting from—this learning experience.
Best regards,
