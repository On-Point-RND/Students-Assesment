The more I live the more I understand the fact that your enviroment predetermine most of the qualities that you have. I am looking forward to participation into SMILES because I want to get as much knowledge from exceptional experts in field of my passion, neural networks and everything that’s related to them. Expanding own perspective is a precursor to creativity. Being able to communicate with other participants allows for broad discussion about possible solutions of complex tasks that are fundamental in deep learning field. Friendly atmosphere of collaboration that this event is going to provide is essential “base” for cross-cultural opinion and knowledge exchange. To be honest I am also very interested in sharing many of my ideas about possible applications NN, LLMs particularly in different real world scenarios. Visiting this event will provide me with an opportunity to get feedback from experienced members of community and gather companions for their implementations among other participants.
