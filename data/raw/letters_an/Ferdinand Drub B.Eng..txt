Dear committee!
I’m glad that schools like this are being held now, as they provide an opportunity to gain cutting-edge knowledge! It would be a great honor for me to interact with other participants, share our projects, and—most importantly—learn more about the work of the school’s lecturers and discuss with them the questions I have about their articles!
I’m a 4th-year student at the Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics at [location]. Over the years of studying in this field, my fundamental knowledge in various areas of biology (gene activity, protein structure, tissue and disease analysis, medical characteristics) has become deeply intertwined with programming skills, ML/DL knowledge, and data analysis. I’m proficient in multiple programming languages (Python, R, bash), SQL, and have a strong mathematical background. I’m familiar with algorithms and statistical data processing. I’ve also worked with tools like Aiirflow, MLflow, Git, Docker, and Kubernetes. I’ve implemented a project on building a recommendation system for an online store and predicting user behavior based on session data. I have experience working with big data—during my studies, I developed a program for processing biological databases and conducting bioinformatic analysis, which helped us discover previously unknown but important genome regions! I’m now actively applying these skills as an analyst at [company], using ML and other methods.
My journey in machine learning began with ML and DL courses at [university] and [university's DLS], but I truly became passionate about this field while working on my thesis under the guidance of [name], a leading expert in ML for bioinformatics and a co-author of multiple Nature papers. For my thesis, I modified the CNN architecture of LegNet (a model for predicting mutation effects), trained it on personalized data, and outperformed state-of-the-art models in accuracy while also reducing memory usage and parameter count—making it suitable for a medical application predicting individual mutation effects.
What excites me most about SMILES is the chance to discuss new approaches in bioinformatics. One promising area is LLMs, but they typically underperform compared to simpler models (like CNN-based LegNet or transformer-based Enformer) in predicting gene activity based on their sequences. I’d love to discuss their limitations and possible solutions during the school.
Another challenge when working with high-dimensional data like genomes is the "curse of dimensionality." However, one of the school’s lecturers, [name], has fascinating research on the "blessing of dimensionality," arguing that random data in high dimensions acquire structured properties. I was deeply impressed by his work and now wonder: can these approaches be applied to biological data? Could they help solve overfitting in models trained on small datasets of rare mutations? I’d also like to explore whether his theorems on stochastic separation could be applied to DNA and epigenetic markers.
Multimodal approaches seem promising for predicting cancer not only from histology but also from genomic data (I took oncology and histology courses and would love to combine these fields in a project). I’d be thrilled to discuss such research with [name], who works on pathology detection in X-rays. Perhaps his methods could be adapted for multi-omics data, where "pathologies" would be abnormal intracellular interactions. Multimodal approaches could also improve my scientific project by integrating gene activity, protein, and metabolite data. Since the organizing institute conducts research in this field, insights from these discussions would be invaluable.
I’m also intrigued by using graph-based models to represent molecular interactions, which could help analyze mutations and their disease links. Some speakers specialize in graph representations, and I’d love to dive deeper into the mathematics behind them!
Additionally, I recently participated in a [company] student camp on generative AI and robotics, where we worked with VLN/VLM models. My project involved ARNOLD, a VLN robot capable of executing tasks while tracking object states. It used language models and reinforcement learning (RL) to improve adaptability. I’d love to explore applying robotics to biochemical experiments and microscopy analysis—currently, mitochondrial shape changes are assessed manually, which is imprecise. I dream of automating this with robots and hope to discuss it with [name] (an RL expert) and [name] (who works on VLM and hybrid rendering with 2D Gaussians—perhaps applicable to mitochondrial dynamics).
I’ve also worked on a diffusion model-based project generating sequences with cell-type-specific activity. I hope the school’s lectures on Generative Approaches will help me refine this work.
After the school, I’d love to collaborate with the lecturers’ labs and contribute my ideas to bioinformatics research! I’m confident SMILES will be a pivotal step in my professional growth, and I’ll do my best to contribute to discussions and projects that could drive breakthroughs in the field.
With respect,
