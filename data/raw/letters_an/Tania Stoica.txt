Dear Admissions Committee Members,
My name is [name], and I would like to express my sincere interest in applying for the summer schoo l of machine learning (SMILES) organized by [compaany]. I
have a strong passion for research and the development of advanced machine-learning methods and
neural networks. I believe that this schoo l will provide me with unique opportunities for scientific
growth and intellectual development.
My enthusiasm for science began in the 10th grade when I was fascinated by physics and participated
in various Olympiads. As a result, I won gold medals in the international Olympiads IZHO and IEPhO
and was also a candidate for the Russian national team. Later, while studying Applied Mathematics
and Info rmatics at [compaany], I was introduced to the fundamentals of machine learning, which shifted
my focus towa rds the rapidlly growing field of artificial intelligence. This motivated me to actively study
related discipline (details can be found in my transcript).
So far, I have had the oppo rtunity to work on several research projects under the guidance of
outstanding specialists who are also teaching in [compaany]. For example, I worked with [name] on knowl edge graph completion using Riem annian opti mization over the manifold of tensors
with fixed multilinear rank. During my internship at the HDI labo ratory, I colla borated with [name] on an Off-policy eva lua tion of new policies in recommender systems. Together with [name], we published a paper on convergence analysis of an opti mization algo rithm that
does not require function values but relie s solely on their co mparisons. Curr ently, as part of my thesis,
I am working on a project on Entropic Optimal Transp ort with [name], a research fellow at the
Bayesian Methods Labo ratory ([compaany] alumnus). Thro ughout my research, I freque ntly apply
methods deve loped by [compaany] researchers.
My current scienti fic interests include generative models in computer vision, specifically opti mal
tra nsport, accele ration, and distillation of diffusion models, as well as large lan gua ge models. I would
like to further develop in these areas under the guidance of experienced researchers from schoo l, as well as contribute to joint research projects and publications.
I guess, the SMILES is one of the best schoo ls in artificial intelligence because it has high ly
experienced specialists, which makes the oppo rtunity to colla borate with them particularly ap pea ling
to me. Another important factor is that students practice communicating in English, which is va luable
for working with researchers from other countries. I believe that the schoo l attracts a high ly intellectu al
enviro nment that stimulates gro wt, and I am confident that studying here will help me deepen my
knowl edge, develop research skills, and prepare for a future career in AI.
After summer schoo l, I plan to continue working in the field of artificial intelligence, whether in
academia or in dustry. I aspire to engage in research and develop inn ovative solutions that can
tran sform industries and improve p eopleâ€™s quality of life. Studying at [compaany] will enable me to
achieve these goals by providing unique educational and research oppo rtunities.
I would be honore d to become part of SMILES and its dynamic academic community. Thank you for
conside ring my application.
Since rely,
[name]
