Application for
SMILES-2025 Summer School
[location]
April 2025
My name is [name], and I am a backend developer with a strong passion for
artificial intelligence and a growing track record of real-world applications. I am
writing to express my sincere interest in participating in the SMILES summer
school.
Over the past few years, I have immersed myself in the world of backend
development, gaining solid experience in Python and C#. One of my most
meaningful projects is the development of a custom Face-ID system, where I built
and optimized facial recognition algorithms tailored for real-time applications.
This project not only deepened my understanding of machine learning but also
ignited my desire to expand my knowledge in AI, particularly in how intelligent
systems can interact with and learn from the world around them.
The SMILES program aligns perfectly with my goals. I am eager to learn from
world-class researchers, sharpen my skills in machine learning, and explore how academic approaches can enhance the performance, reliability, and ethics of the
systems I build. I view this opportunity not only as a chance to grow, but as a step
toward contributing more meaningfully to the AI community.
Beyond technical skills, I bring a deep sense of curiosity, a collaborative mindset,
and a strong work ethic. I am always willing to contribute, whether it’s by
supporting fellow participants, sharing knowledge, or assisting in research or
development tasks. I believe in lifelong learning and in pushing the boundaries of
what we can do through code, creativity, and collaboration.
“I’m intimidated by the fear of being average.”
These words by [name] reflect the way I approach both my professional and
personal development. I don’t settle for “good enough.” I aim to build systems that
matter — and to become someone who makes a difference.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to be a part of
SMILES and look forward to the possibility of learning, contributing, and growing
within your program.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
