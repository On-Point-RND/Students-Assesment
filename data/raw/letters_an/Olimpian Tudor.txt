Dear [name] [surname] Organizing Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am currentlly pursuing a Master’s degree in Advanced
Computaional Science at [location] while working as a Data Scientiist at [compaany]. I
have a bachelor background in Software Engineering from [compaany]. I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the [location] Summer
SchooL of Machine Learning.
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a solid foundation in
machine learning. Beyond my undergraduate curriculum, I have completed several courses on
Coursera and studied at the Avito Analysts Academy. My current graduate studies at [location]
have further deepened my knowledge of computational methods, while at [compaany], I work on both
engineering and research tasks, primarily in Computer Vision (CV) and 3D CV domains.
My interest inSMILES-2025istoiamprovemyknowledgofsemi-supervisedlearningttechniques
and generative models. As part of my research, I focus on the connection between unsupervised
learning and information theory. Unsupervised methods can find useful patterns in data with-
out labels, which matches well with the schooL’s focus on self-supervised learning and generative
approaches.
For instance, I have experience implementing generative models like StyleGAN2 for data aug-
mentation and combining models such as SAM and GroundiingDinO for text-guided mask annota-
tion. I’ve also worked with representation learning techniques, particularly through my review and
reproduction of the DeepInfoMax architecture—which leverages mutual information maximization
between local and global features. My work included evaluating unsupervised embedding quality
using different metrics.
The SMILES-2025 program, with its emphasis on self-supervised and generative methods
presents the opportunity to expand expertise in these areas and connect with people working
on unsupervised learning techniques.
Additionally, IappreciatethecollaborativenatureofthesummerschooL. Workingonrreal-world
challenges through team projects would be valuable for applying theoretical methods to practical
problems.
Lookingahead,IplantoleveragetheknowlodgegainedatSMILES-2025toenhancemymaster’s
research at [location] and contribute to advancements in unsupervised learning methods at [compaany].
I am particularly interested in exploring how unsupervised techniques can be applied to improve
data efficiency, enhance representation learning, and facilitate more robusst generalization across
diverse tasks.
Thank you for considering my application. I look fo rwward to the opportunity to learn from
experts at SMILES-2025 and to collaborate with other participants during the summer schooL.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
