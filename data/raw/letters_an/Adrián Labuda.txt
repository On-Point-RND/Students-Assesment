Subject: Application for Participation in SMILES-2025 School on Generative Methods in Artificial Intelligence
Dear Members of the Selection Committee,
My name is [name], and I express sincere interest in participating in your school dedicated to generative methods in artificial intelligence. My academic and professional journey is closely tied to a constant drive to deepen my knowledge in the field of AI, making SMILES-2025 an ideal opportunity to develop competencies, strengthen international collaboration, and address real-world industry challenges.
My professional path began with front-end development, where I acquired skills in project work and interaction with cross-functional teams. However, already in my fourth year of undergraduate studies in software engineering, I realized the need to transition to more complex tasks related to data analysis. In my master's program in fundamental computer science, I independently studied machine learning methods, focusing on computer vision.
The choice of my master's thesis topic on sign language recognition was a deliberate step: I aimed to create a tool that would help overcome communication barriers between hearing and deaf individuals without the need to memorize regional variations of signs. At the start, this was a modest research project with a basic CNN-LSTM architecture, limited to recognizing isolated gestures. As experts note, modern systems already operate with thousands of gestures, but my initial experience allowed me to understand the fundamental principles of working with video annotations and optimizing neural networks for the specifics of sign semiotics. Despite the limited scope (working with individual gestures instead of continuous speech), the project revealed key challenges: the need to account for facial expressions and articulation, processing temporal dependencies in gesture sequences, and adapting to regional variations. These challenges, as practice shows among leading developers, require an in-depth understanding of multimodal architectures and generative methods.
Currently, while pursuing a second master's degree in applied AI, I am deepening my knowledge in machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing and reinforcement learning. In my current job, I actively apply these skills in several projects:
– A chatbot based on the RAG scheme for analyzing corporate documents, where I integrate vector databases and fine-tune language models for the company’s domain;
– Recognition and data extraction from travel documents using computer vision and NLP to automate accounting processes;
– Development of AI agents for automating routine tasks, including request classification and report generation.
These projects require constant interaction with multimodal data and solutions, which directly aligns with the theme of SMILES-2025.
The areas of generative models, multimodal methods, and multi-agent systems represent a key interest for me both as a researcher and practitioner. While working on my master's dissertation, focused on recognizing Russian Sign Language in videos, I encountered limitations of existing approaches to processing video data. This prompted me to study modern computer vision and NLP methods; however, the depth of their application in real cases can only be unlocked through direct experience exchange with experts, which is one of the goals of SMILES-2025.
Moreover, the school’s program perfectly aligns with my long-term plans: advancing in the field of applied AI with a focus on cross-cultural and multilingual solutions. Participating in joint projects with representatives from the [compaany] will be a unique chance to combine technical knowledge with my interest in [location] culture, which I actively cultivate through language studies (HSK3) and the history of [location]'s technological progress.
My goal is to become a specialist in multimodal AI systems capable of solving problems at the intersection of technology and socio-cultural needs. Specifically, I plan to develop projects on automating sign language translation with the integration of cultural nuances (e.g., differences between Russian and [location] sign languages). Perhaps this will become my next thesis project.
Participation in SMILES-2025 will act as a catalyst for:
– Adapting the acquired knowledge to improve the accuracy of context-dependent gesture recognition;
– Transitioning from specialized tasks to managing complex AI projects;
– Initiating collaborative research efforts.
SMILES-2025 offers a rare opportunity to combine intensive learning with cultural exchange, fully aligning with my academic and career priorities. I am ready to actively participate in all stages of the program, including hackathons and cultural events, to maximize the school’s potential for professional growth.
Sincerely,
