Dear organizers of the [compaany] Summer School,
Three years ago, I stood at a crossroads: continue pursuing science or step into the alluring world of commercial enterprise. At that moment, I had just completed an intensive data analytics school and was deeply immersed in scientific research at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The head of our research center, someone I profoundly respected, invited me to join their lab permanently. Yet, driven by youthful curiosity and a desire to test myself in the "real world," I declined, stepping instead into a corporate role at a leading financial institution.
I clearly remember his words: "Once you leave science for corporate life, it changes you. It's rare for people to return with the same creativity and enthusiasm." At the time, I dismissed this notion confidentially. Three years later, I see what he meant. While my role in commercial banking allows me to engage with advanced machine learning applications, it has become increasingly evident that innovation within large corporate structures often faces resistance due to entrenched processes and a general reluctance toward embracing the new.
Despite this, my passion for discovery and innovation remains undiminished. Outside my daily responsibilities, I constantly seek out challenges that reignite my excitement: participating in Kaggle competitions, joining hackathons, conducting independent research, and actively exploring startup ideas. Yet, despite these individual efforts, I increasingly feel isolated - like I'm drifting in a corporate sea, disconnected from peers who share my passion and curiosity.
This is precisely why the [compaany] Summer School appeals deeply to me. Beyond just another learning opportunity, [compaany] represents a rare convergence of vibrant minds from [location] and [location] - peers and mentors who are as driven as I am to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence through innovative research and real-world applications. I yearn to reconnect with an academic environment, collaborate on meaningful projects, and build lasting relationships with like-minded individuals who are equally passionate about exploring the cutting edge of machine learning.
My academic and professional journey has equipped me with substantial experience in machine learning and deep learning. I have successfully applied these skills in varied domains, from developing robust forecasting systems and AI-powered support agents at [compaany] to harnessing satellite imagery for predictive analytics in agriculture at [compaany]. These experiences, combined with my active engagement in competitions, conferences, and hackathons, have solidified my expertise. However, the restrictive pace of corporate environments makes it challenging to maintain the momentum of innovation and creative experimentation.
From [compaany], I have clear expectations: I aim to absorb cutting-edge methodologies, engage intensively with contemporary research topics, and, crucially, establish a network of motivated peers and mentors. My long-term aspiration is to bridge academic innovation with impactful entrepreneurial ventures - ideally, launching a technology-driven startup grounded in meaningful scientific research. The summer school, I believe, will serve as the perfect catalyst to reignite my creative drive, providing the inspiration and connections necessary to step confidently toward this vision. Reflecting on the conversation with the research center head years ago, I now realize he wasn't entirely correct. Yes, corporate life has shaped me - but it hasn't extinguished my creativity or diminished my curiosity. Instead, it has sharpened my resolve to pursue what truly inspires me. Now, more than ever, I feel ready to return to the "race" of meaningful innovation and scientific exploration. Attending [compaany] is more than just a logical next step - it is a deeply personal and purposeful commitment to rediscovering and reinforcing my true scientific identity.
Best regards,
