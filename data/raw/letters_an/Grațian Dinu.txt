Motivation Letter for SMILES-2025
My name is [name], and I am currently a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence at [compaany]. Studying entirely in English at an international university, I am fully prepared and comfortable engaging with the English-language environment of SMILES-2025.
Over the past three years, my enthusiasm for machine learning—especially generative models, multimodal systems, and large language models (LLMs)—has evolved from practical applications towards a deep interest in scientific research. At the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of [location], I gained valuable experience developing NLP models and automatic speech recognition systems for minority languages. Additionally, my roles in startups like [compaany] and [compaany] allowed me to deepen my practical expertise, particularly in fine-tuning and optimizing LLMs, and creating sophisticated multi-agent systems aimed at enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of language models.
More recently, I have increasingly focused on academic research. I have authored several scientific drafts, such as my study on TALC, a novel probabilistic approach to optimizing tool selection by LLMs, and research investigating multi-agent systems and prompt engineering techniques to enhance the precision and logic of mathematical computations in LLMs. These experiences have solidified my aspiration to contribute meaningfully to AI research.
Participating in notable events such as the ISSCAI International AI School at the Higher School of Economics and the AI Workshop Week at [compaany] provided crucial exposure to cutting-edge topics in NLP, CV, and ASR. These experiences have reinforced my belief in the value of collaborative research and international networking.
SMILES-2025 is particularly appealing to me due to its comprehensive focus on generative AI, multimodal approaches, and multi-agent systems—all central to my research interests. I am eager to interact with leading international experts, collaborate closely with like-minded researchers, and assess and strengthen my current skills in a stimulating academic environment.
Furthermore, attending SMILES-2025 aligns with my long-standing fascination with [location]. Experiencing [location] culture firsthand, especially in a city as historically and culturally significant as [location], is a personal dream. I believe this cultural immersion will greatly enrich my perspective both academically and personally.
Looking forward, my primary career goal is to deepen my involvement in scientific research, particularly exploring multimodal and multi-agent methods to advance generative AI capabilities. I seek a supportive, intellectually vibrant team to better understand my strengths and further my development as a researcher.
Thank you very much for considering my application. I am genuinely excited about the possibility of joining the dynamic community of SMILES-2025.
