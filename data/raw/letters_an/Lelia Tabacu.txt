Dear Organizing Committee,
I am writing to express my interest in participating in the SMILES Summer School. As a recent graduate with a strong theoretical background and active research experience in machine learning, I see this program as an important opportunity to deepen my technical skills, engage with the international ML community, and contribute to cutting-edge research.
One of the main reasons I want to attend SMILES is to connect with researchers and professionals who share a passion for theory-driven machine learning. While individual study (such as reading papers) is essential, I believe that collaborating with peers and exchanging ideas spark the most exciting ideas that might not emerge through solitary work alone. SMILES offers a unique environment to exchange knowledge, share my own research, and gain insights that can shape the direction of my future work.
My current research focuses on neural network compression and quantization methods. Alongside this, I work with generative models, multimodal systems, and large language models in practical settings, gaining substantial experience in managing and optimizing cutting-edge architectures. Because of this, the themes of the SMILES summer school strongly align with my research interests. At the same time, I am eager to explore these areas from new perspectivesâ€”diving deeper into theoretical foundations, alternative modeling approaches, and research beyond my current scope. I believe the supervised projects and lectures at SMILES will provide exactly that opportunity, helping me grow as a researcher and broaden the impact of my work.
Participating in SMILES presents a great opportunity to discover new research interests, deepen my technical skills, and collaborate with a community of researchers passionate about shaping the future of AI.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
