Your program’s focus on real-world ML applications aligns perfectly with my goal to bridge finance and AI. I aim to:
1. Deepen my ML/DL knowledge, especially in time-series forecasting (e.g., loan default prediction).
2. Collaborate with peers to solve industry problems, leveraging my domain expertise.
What I Bring
● Hands-on experience with data preprocessing (cleaning financial datasets) and basic model deployment.
● A practitioner’s perspective on risk assessment challenges in emerging markets.
Post-program, I plan to develop open-source tools for SME credit scoring in [location]. I’d welcome the chance to discuss how my background can contribute to your community.
