Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing with great enthusiasm to apply for the SMILES. As a Research Engineer at [compaany], specializing in the application of AI to medical imaging and neural network security, I am confident that my participation in the school would be mutually beneficial.
The focus of SMILES-2025 on cutting-edge topics such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Approaches, Multi-agent Systems, and especially Safe AI, aligns perfectly with my research interests and recent work. My Master's thesis and subsequent research activities at [compaany] have centered on enhancing the robustness and security of machine learning models.
A key achievement in this area is my work on developing and implementing an innovative watermarking method for neural networks. This research aimed to create schemes probably robust against model stealing attacks. I am pleased to report that the results of this research have been accepted for publication at the prestigious International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-2024, an A* conference) in the paper titled "Probabilistically Robust Watermarking of Neural Networks" (arXiv:2401.08261), which I co-authored. This experience has provided me with a deep understanding of the vulnerabilities of modern AI models and the critical importance of developing reliable protection methods, directly relating to the "Safe AI" theme of your school's program. I have also investigated membership inference attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms.
Beyond my research in AI security, I possess practical skills in developing and implementing automated analysis systems for medical images (MRI, CT, PET) using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures (including 3D segmentation) with PyTorch. My educational background from [institution] and [compaany] has equipped me with a strong theoretical foundation in applied mathematics, physics, and data science. I am proficient in Python and the key libraries for ML/DL, image processing, and data analysis.
Participating in SMILES-2025 represents a unique opportunity for me to deepen my knowledge of generative models, particularly LLMs and multimodal systems, under the guidance of leading global experts from [compaany] and the [institution]. I am also eager to actively engage in the practical workshops and hackathon to apply learned concepts to real-world problems. The international nature of the school and the chance to collaborate with researchers from [location] are particularly appealing for exchanging ideas and building professional connections. I am prepared to share my experience in AI watermarking and security during the poster session and actively contribute to discussions and teamwork.
Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my research experience, technical skills, and strong motivation make me a suitable candidate for the on-site participation in SMILES.
Best regards,
[name],
Research Engineer, [compaany]
