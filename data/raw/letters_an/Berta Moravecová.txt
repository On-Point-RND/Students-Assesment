Dear Members of the Admission Committee,
My name is [name]. I am currently a first-year Master's student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering at [compaany]. Additionally, I hold a Bachelor’s degree with honors from [compaany]. My undergraduate thesis, titled "Code Summarization Beyond Function Level," was accepted at a workshop of an A*-level conference; details can be found in the presentation attached to this application. With this letter, I would like to express my strong motivation to participate in the Skoltech Machine Learning Summer School (SMILES) 2025.
My interest in joining SMILES 2025 stems from several reasons. Foremost, the field of Artificial Intelligence is exceptionally relevant and engaging to me. I have substantial experience with machine learning, NLP, large language models, and retrieval-augmented generation. I have experience in writing scientific papers, approach coding and report writing with great responsibility, and am continuously striving to expand my knowledge and skills further. Your summer school, renowned for its distinguished experts and inspiring speakers, offers an ideal environment for such professional and academic growth. The opportunity to learn directly from leading professionals and exchange knowledge with them is a substantial incentive for me.
Moreover, I am enthusiastic about visiting [location], a global leader in technological innovation, and immersing myself in its rich culture. Previously, I have attended several similar events, including [compaany] “studcamps”, the [compaany] SOTA school, and [compaany] Summer School. However, participating in an international summer school abroad, particularly one emphasizing solutions to real-world industrial problems, represents an entirely new and profoundly exciting experience that I eagerly seek. My teammate from the [compaany] Summer School 2024, [name], participated in SMILES 2024 and highly recommended your school, further reinforcing my enthusiasm for joining this program.
I perceive participation in SMILES 2025 as an invaluable opportunity to better understand the latest global scientific trends and innovations, as well as a source of inspiration for my continued development in this field. I am eager to connect with talented peers sharing similar interests and to become a part of your vibrant community of students and industry experts.
I am particularly interested in generative approaches and their industrial applications, as well as practical workshops focusing on this area. Furthermore, given my current position as a research engineer at [compaany] (a scientific partner of the school), exploring large language models, multimodal methods, and multi-agent systems would be especially beneficial, as these directly align with my research interests and institutional responsibilities.
The knowledge and skills acquired during the summer school will significantly contribute to both my scientific research and professional activities in the field of artificial intelligence. I am confident that participation in your program will represent an essential milestone in my professional and academic growth.
Thank you very much for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name]
