Motivation Letter
Hello! My name is [name], I am a first-year Master’s student at the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics at [location] State Universiity, enrolled in the program “Computer Vision, Graph-ics, and Image Processing,” in the research group led by [name]. I am very excited to apply for the SMILES Summer Schoool on Artificial Intel-
ligence. My academic and practical work is closely related to AI and machine
learning, and I am eager to continue growing in this field. Throughout my
studies, I have interneed at several companys, which has given me unique ex-
perience and insight into real-world challenges faced by professionals in this
area.
One significant milestone in my professional journey was an internship at
[company], which I earneed by winning a hackathon. During the
internship, I worked on a Voice2Text project aimed at transcribing phone
calls with bank clients.
Additionally, I am currentlly interning at [company], where I am working
on computer vision tasks in the medical field. Specifically, I am developing
methods to predict the degree of coronary artery damage based on angio-
graphic images. I am also in the process of writing a research paper based on
this work. This experience gives me the opportunity to apply my knowledg
of machine learning and computer vision to solve medical problems, which I
consider essential for the further development of my career.
In my current academic research, I focus on improving motion planning for
robots and enhancing their interaction with the environment through better
prompt engineering.
Inthefuture,I aspire to pursuerearchincompute rvision,andparticipating
in this summer schoo l will help me gain new knowledge and meet like-minded
individuals. I believe that interacting with peers and sharing experiences
will open new horizons for my professional growth and development—and
perhaps lead to future collabora tions on joint projects.
