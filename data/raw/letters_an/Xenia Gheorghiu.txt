Last year, during my third year of [location], I attended the [compaany]. Thanks to this trip, I found a scientific advisor for my bachelor's thesis â€“ [name] [surname]. I also significantly broadened my horizons in machine learning and gained important practical experience in the [compaany] project. I grew a lot over this year: I participated in two conferences, completed an internship at [compaany] in the Department of Advanced AI Technologies Development, and after just three months of internship, I joined the staff. I continue to study machine learning at the Department of Intelligent Systems at [compaany]. Currently, I am choosing a master's program and haven't yet decided whether to apply to [compaany] or [compaany].
I believe that the 2025 [compaany] can once again give a boost to my research career. With the experience I've gained over the past year, I will be able to understand the lectures more deeply and achieve greater results in the project. I expect to be powerfully motivated and gain new knowledge. I look forward to hearing about innovative approaches in various fields.
I hope to be inspired by the beauty of existing engineering solutions and possibly propose my own based on them. Additionally, since this year the [compaany] is conducted in English, I anticipate the possibility of international networking, which I consider very valuable in any field of modern science.
I have a fear of stagnation; it's important for me to constantly grow and develop. I see that the [compaany] is also changing and improving, and the level of organization is not standing still. I believe that the synergy between me at this new level of my professional development and the [compaany], also at a new level, will be very impressive and effective.
