Motivation Letter
My name is [name], and I am a first-year student at [location] University of [compaany], majoring in Business Informatics. I would like to take part in the SMILES-2025 Summer SchooL on Machine Learning, organized by [compaany] in collaboration with the [location] Institute of Technology.
I am very interested in artificial intelligence and how it can be used to solve real-life problems. SMILES-2025 caught my attention as a unique opportunity to learn more about generative models, large language models, and multi-agent systems. I believe this program will help me grow as a future professional and teach me how to apply AI tools in business, healtcare, and education.
My academic and personal interests are interdisciplinary. I e njoy learning about psychology and sociology, which help me better understand human behavio r and communication. I have written a scientific article titled “Manipulation of Society by [compaany] through Advertising and Marketing,” which explores how media can shape public perception. This reflects my broader interest in how techno logy and social systems interact.
My interest in IT comes from its powerful role in today’s wo rld. I am c urrently learning programming and data analysis, and plan to study Python and ML libraries such as Scikit-learn and PyTorch. While I haven’t yet worked on large AI projects, I am very motivated to gain prac tical experience. One of my goals is to develop useful tools like a medical assistant AI or a smart budgeting app to help p eople in everyday life.
In the future, I hope to launch my own business, combining my knowl edge in business, AI, and human behavio r. I believe entrepreneurial skills can be le arned through experience and tea mwork, and I see AI as a tool that should support, not replace, human roles.
SMILES-2025 is a great oppo rtunity to learn from experts, colla borate with international students, and take part in hands-on projects and hackathons. I’m especially interested in the practica l workshops and mentoring opportunities. I believe these experiences will not o nly expand my technical knowl edge but also improve my tea mwork and creative thinking skills.
I also want to contribute to the schooL community by actively participating in research and sharing my ideas and experiences. My passion for p eople, communication, and problem-solv ing can be a va luable part of group work and discussions.
I am preparing for a future where human qualities like critical thinking, creativity, and empathy will be just as important as technical skills. I want to become som eone who not o nly uses AI tools but leads their ethical and practical application in real life.
Thank you for conside ring my application. I believe SMILES-2025 will inspire me and give me the fo undation to move fo rward in my career with confidence and purpose.
Best regards,
