Motivation Letter for the SMILES-2025 Machine Learning Summer School
Dear Selection Committee of the SMILES-2025 Summer School, 
My name is [name], and I am writing to enthusiastically apply for participation in the SMILES-2025 Machine Learning Summer School. I am currently studying at the Institute of Information Technologies and Intelligent Systems (ITIS) of [location] University, specializing in Digital Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Technologies. My primary objective is to secure a scholarship for a master's programme at a [location] university, and I believe attending your summer school would represent a crucial milestone in achieving this ambition. 
This distinctive programme, organised jointly by [company] and the [location] Institute of Technology (HIT), presents an exceptional opportunity for students and early-career researchers seeking to enhance their expertise in generative AI methodologies. At present, I am actively studying Mandarin and preparing for my IELTS and HSK examinations. 
Regarding my experience, I have dedicated the past two years to intensive study of machine learning and its diverse applications. I have independently completed several courses, including "Machine Learning and Semantic Analysis", and have participated in numerous hackathons, which have honed my ability to collaborate on large-scale projects. 
This experience has significantly deepened my knowledge and developed practical skills in Python programming, working with libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, and data analysis. Furthermore, I have implemented several projects, including developing a neural network for image classification and creating an RNN-based chatbot. These initiatives have provided me with hands-on experience and advanced my understanding of ML and DL. 
I am also actively engaged in research, applying theoretical knowledge to practical contexts through participation in academic conferences and research projects. I conduct research at both [location] and [location] University, having presented conference papers on "Neural Network Architecture Optimisation for Resource-Constrained Devices" and "System Architectures for Multimodal Machine Learning". Additionally, I am enrolled in a digital department programme focusing on "Fundamentals of Data Analysis in Scientific Research" with instruction in the R programming language. 
In 2025, I participated in the Floating University's winter school hackathon focused on machine learning applications, and I plan to collaborate with the project further, potentially joining their Arctic expedition. I also intend to apply to School 21 in the near future. 
I have chosen to apply to SMILES-2025 as it offers the unique opportunity to learn from leading machine learning experts such as [name], [name], and [name]. I am particularly eager to learn directly from Associate Professor [name] about the Affective Computing Committee of the China Society of Information Processing, hoping to gain valuable insights applicable to my future research. 
Moreover, I look forward to exchanging knowledge with like-minded peers. I am confident that participation will broaden my horizons regarding international collaboration, enabling me to establish and maintain connections with brilliant minds in the field. It will also deepen my understanding of contemporary methods and technologies while developing the skills necessary for a successful career in this rapidly evolving domain. 
As I am currently studying Mandarin through university language courses, this summer school will facilitate my integration into the international community, allowing me to understand different professional mentalities and work cultures while building connections with Chinese colleagues. I have great admiration for Chinese culture and would welcome the opportunity to participate in cultural excursions. 
Participation in SMILES-2025 will enable me to meet and exchange knowledge with colleagues from [location], begin solving real industry problems, find an additional academic supervisor, and gain invaluable international cooperation experience. I aspire to study new approaches and algorithms in machine learning that will benefit my future research and projects, particularly in scientific work. 
Expectations 
I anticipate gaining practical experience with advanced AI technologies, including generative models, multimodal approaches, large language models, and multi-agent systems. I also hope to access cutting-edge lectures, practical seminars, and hackathons focused on solving real-world industry challenges. I aim to deepen my knowledge in areas such as large language models, multimodal approaches, and multi-agent systems. Furthermore, I hope the programme will facilitate valuable connections with experts and participants who can support my professional development and help realise my ideas in artificial intelligence. 
Moreover, I expect to find an additional academic supervisor for collaborative research work and co-authoring scholarly articles for publication in high-impact academic journals. 
Additionally, I plan to actively participate in cultural excursions to better understand Chinese traditions and culture. As a beginner in Mandarin, I hope to improve my communication skills during the school. I also intend to volunteer for SMILES-2025, contributing to event organisation while developing additional interpersonal skills. 
Following my master's degree, I plan to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, potentially teaching at a world-leading institution such as Harvard. I am committed to developing my career in research and innovative solution development to advance machine learning technologies. I also aim to continue developing my startup, which focuses on integrating AI with drone technology in the agricultural sector, exploring new technological possibilities. 
Participation in SMILES-2025 will be a pivotal step in this journey, providing the essential knowledge, skills, and professional connections for a successful career and future. 
Sincerely, 
[name] 
AWESOME
