Admissions Committee
SMILES-2025 Summer School
[compaany]
Dear Members of the Admissions Committee,
I am writing to apply for the SMILES-2025 summer school. As someone deeply engaged in machine
learning research and development, I see this program as an exceptional opportunity to deepen my expertise
in generative AI while contributing my unique perspective to your academic community.
My academic background includes a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from [location] State
University’s Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics, where I developed strong foundations in
algorithms and machine learning. Currently, I am completing my Master’s in Financial Technologies and Data
Analysis at [compaany] while actively working as an ML Engineer at [compaany] and conducting research at
[compaany]'s LAMBDA Labo ratory.
My professional experience at [compaany] has allowed me to work on practical implementations of
neural networks for transaction analysis and contribute to federated learning frameworks. This industry
experience has given me valuable insights into deploying machine learning solutions at scale. At the same
time, my research at LAMBDA Labo ratory focuses on advancing large language models through the
LingvaInterpreter project, where I develop optimization techniques and benchmarking frameworks for
AI-generated solutions.
The focus of SMILES-2025 on generative AI and multi-agent systems particularly resonates with my
research interests and professional trajectory. Having worked extensively with both theoretical and applied
aspects of machine learning, I am eager to explore how cutting-edge techniques in these domains can push the
boundaries of what’s possible in AI development. I believe the program’s intensive format and
research-oriented approach will provide the perfect environment to expand my knowledge and refine my
research skills. My combination of academic research experience and practical ML implementation knowledge
positions me to contribute meaningfully to discussions and collaborative projects.
Looking toward the future, I aspire to establish myself as a researcher working at the forefront of
generative AI development. Participating in SMILES-2025 would represent a significant step toward this goal,
providing me with the tools, connections, and inspiration needed to make meaningful contributions to the
field. The program’s international perspective and emphasis on innovation align perfectly with my
professional ambitions.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to join the SMILES-2025 community and
contribute to its mission of advancing machine learning research.
Yours sincerely,
