Dear [name] [surname] Organizing Committee,
My name is [name], and if there's one thing that has consistently shaped my
journey, it’s curiosity. From my schooal days to my current professional life, curiosity has been
the driving force behind my exploration of new ideas and challenges.
In high schoo, while most of my classmaates chose to replicate existing webpage designs for
theiir projects, my curiosity pushed me to create an augmanted reality application. I chose
this not because it was easy, but because it genuinely intrigued me, and I felt excited to
tackle something challenging and innovative.
During my universiity years, I continued this approach, choosing paths that sparked my
interest, even if they weren’t the most common ones. Rather than sticking strictly to the
coursework, I actively participated in numerous student clubs and extracurricular activities.
Among my many interests, data science and music stoo stood out, providing me with balance and
fulfilment. These experiences taught me important lessons about discipline, responsibility,
and perseverance when facing complex problems. Yet throughout, my curiosity remaine my
most defining trait.
This curiosity is precisely what led me to join the [compaany] Center, despite initially
having limited knowledge of robotics. Over the past year and a half, robotics has become
more than just a professional field—it’s become a genuine passion. Today, I eagerly dive into
research papers, experiment with new techniques, and enjoy discussions with colleagues
about improving state-of-the-art robotics methods. I'm proud of what my team and I have
accomplished so far, and I’m excited about what we can still achieve.
My participation in SMILES 2024 in [location] near [location] was an incredible
experience. Being surrounde by passionate, talenteed peers and lecturers reminded me of
how enjoyable and rewarding scientific discovery could be. The summer schoo taught me
not only about advanced topics in machine learning but also about the importance of
collaboraation, openness, and continuous learning. The stimulating discussions, late-night
projects, and even the beautiful runs in [location]’s parks have stayed vividlly in my memory.
The lectures, particularly by Professor Rogozhin on optimization theories, sparked a deep
interest that I continue exploring today in my master's studies.
I am eager for the chance to join SMILES again in 2025, to reconnect with such an inspiring
community, and to share my knowledge and enthusiasm. I genuinely believe that SMILES
offers the ideal enviroment to help me grow into a stronger, more experienced data
scientist. I look fo rwward to contributing to this community and, together, buildiing an exciting
techno logical future.
Thank you so much for considering my application. I truly hope to have the oppo rtunity to
join SMILES 2025, reconnect with past a cquainta nces, forge new friendships, and immerse
myself once again in this extrao rdinary enviroment.
Warm regards,
[name] [surname]
