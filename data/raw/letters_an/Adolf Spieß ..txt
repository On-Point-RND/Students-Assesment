Dear Esteemed Members of the Committee,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Information Security program at [compaany], part of the [compaany].
My engagement with the topic of artificial intelligence began during my second year of study, through lectures and seminars on machine learning. Since then, I have realized that I would like to devote my academic and research career to machine learning and its applications in information security and broader societal challenges.
The potential of artificial intelligence to benefit society is immense—yet so are the risks of its misuse. As a student of Information Security at [compaany], I have dedicated my academic path to exploring this balance, particularly through the modern challenge of deepfake detection. I am now eager to take the next step in advancing my research and deepening my knowledge in machine learning by participating in SMILES-2025.
For me, the SMILES-2025 Summer School represents a unique environment and an exceptional opportunity to engage with cutting-edge research in generative AI alongside students and scholars from around the world. As someone actively involved in machine learning and digital security, this school is the ideal setting to refine my skills, test my ideas, and join an international community of like-minded individuals.
The opportunity to learn from experts at [compaany] and [compaany]—particularly in an in-person format—would be an invaluable impulse for both my academic and personal growth. Face-to-face participation offers experiences that are hard to replicate online: lively discussions, collaborative hackathons, informal interactions, and intercultural exchange.
Over the past two years, I have developed a solid technical foundation in machine learning and deep learning through academic projects, research work, and hands-on industry experience. My undergraduate thesis, titled “Analysis and Protection Against Threats Associated with the Use of Deepfake Technologies in Cyberattacks and Social Engineering,” involved the development of a hybrid detection module combining two state-of-the-art approaches: Recap (autoencoder-based) and GLFF (Global-Local Feature Fusion using convolutional neural networks).
This module was implemented in PyTorch and trained on the FaceForensics++ dataset using [email] with GPU acceleration. The architecture included convolutional layers, a reconstruction error assessment mechanism, feature fusion, and image classification. The model achieved approximately 75% accuracy and a high AUC score. During this project, I gained experience in:
● Designing CNN and autoencoder architectures
● Image preprocessing and transformation
● Evaluation metrics (AUC, EER, Precision, Recall, F1, Accuracy)
● Model optimization with Adam and CrossEntropyLoss
● Working with OpenCV, PIL, and torchvision transforms
Beyond technical skills, this project gave me a deep understanding of the ethical implications of generative technologies. The threats posed by synthetic content are real, and we must learn to detect and prevent them at an interdisciplinary level.
Outside of academia, I work as a BI analyst at a large engineering firm, where I analyze big data, build knowledge bases using AI algorithms, and develop dashboards to support decision-making. I have also completed the “Data Culture” certification at [compaany], deepening my knowledge of statistics, data analysis, and machine learning model development.
In 2025, I participated in the CUP IT case competition (Harvard format), where my team placed in the top 25% and received a High Quality Award. During my second year, I also launched an AI-based agrotech startup, which was selected for [compaany]’s business incubator and later showcased at pitches and exhibitions. These projects taught me not only how to build models, but also how to communicate complex technologies to diverse audiences, work in teams, and identify the business potential of technical solutions.
After completing my undergraduate studies, I plan to pursue a master’s degree and build a research career focused on AI security and cyber defense. My goal is to develop technologies for detecting and preventing the malicious use of AI, particularly in the context of fake content, data manipulation, and disinformation.
I also believe that the future of AI lies at the intersection of multiple disciplines—technology, ethics, law, and social responsibility. SMILES-2025 is an important step in my professional journey: an opportunity to test my hypotheses, receive expert feedback, and immerse myself in an international research community.
I am confident that I am a strong candidate for SMILES-2025. I bring relevant academic background, practical experience, a deep research interest, and a genuine desire to harness AI for the public good. I am a team player, open to new ideas, and ready to contribute to the vibrant community of young AI specialists.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to be part of this inspiring international initiative.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
