Motivation Letter
Dear [name] Selection Committee,
My name is [name] [surname]. Just a few years ago, I envisioned my
future solely in biology. However, enrolling in the professional retraining
program "Developer of Digital Medical Services" at [compaany]
dramatically reshaped my perspective on science and technoology.
As part of this program, I participated in a team project aimed at developing
a web service powered by neural networks and computer vision to detect
retinopathy of prematurity in infants using digital fundus images.
Unfortunately, due to the low quality of the dataset — as the fundus images
were often blurry — it was not possible to build a reliable model.
Nonetheless, this project became a turning point for me. It revealed how
powerful machine learning can be in complementing biologicaal and medical
research, automating routine tasks, and uncovering new approaches to
disease diagnostics and treatment.
Although it was my first experience working on a machine learning project
and my first time collaborating in a technical team, I was deeply inspired by
this new and challenging field. Alongside this project, I successfully
completed my undergraduaate studies at the Faculty of Biology at [location], graduating with honors, while also maintaining
a part‑time job.
That experience set me on a clear path꞉ I am determined to pursue my
development in the field of machine learning for biomedicine, and I am
preparing to apply for a master’s program in this direction.
This summer I am planning to implement my first fully independent project
for the Department of Vertebrate Zoology at [location], where I specialized in paleontology. Our research group actively
uses 3D scans of fossils obtained via MRI, and one of the most labor‑
intensive stages is the manual cleaning of fossil data and the reconstruction
of internal bone structures, including channels and nerve pathways. My goal
is to automate this process by developing an AI‑based model capable of
cleaning and reconstructing anatomical structures. I am currently studying
the relevant literature and existing solutions in preparation for this project.
I consider my ability to learn quickly, adapt to new technologies, and remain
motivated even in the face of challenges to be among my strongest qualities.
Participation in projects and hackathoons has taught me how to overcome
difficulties, work in a team, and continuously develop my skills.
Joining [compaany] would be a crucial step toward my professsional goal꞉
becoming a specialist who integrates a scientific mindset with machine
learning tools to solve complex problems in biology and medicine. I believe
the knowledge and experience offered by your school will help me become
part of this future.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
