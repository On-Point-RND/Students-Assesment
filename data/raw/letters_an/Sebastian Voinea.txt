Hello!
My name is [name], and I am very eager to apply for participation in
the international summer school SMILES-2025. Artificial Intelligence is not
just a fashionable trend, but an area where I think the future of science,
technology, and communications is really taking shape. For me, this trip is an
opportunity to join a new ecosystem with innovative ideas, different experiences
and a lot of people with interesting research.
I study and develop in the field of statistics and machine learning - these
fields attract me, as I am interested in real applied problems, building rigorous
algorithms, also very interesting in big data analytics, as the results can
sometimes be very surprising. Biology has also entered into the spheres of my
interest. This science is so diverse that it has links to many other sciences.
Nowadays, a lot of people involved in programming are interested in the field of
artificial intelligence, but I think that bioinformatics and how programming can
be used to study the human body, the genome, and processes in nature is just as
fascinating.
My introduction to these fields started in 8th grade with classical
problems: regression, clustering, feature selection and basic model building. But
over time I realised that ML/DL is a very fast growing field, especially with the
advent of AI, and what interesting perspectives are opened up with deeper
learning. However, it is also surprising that with such possibilities, many
processes in important fields such as medicine are still performed by humans,
although many analyses, interpretation of results and similar processes can
be performed by machine algorithms.
Among other things, I am currently interested in large language models. I
follow with great interest how approaches to text generation, integration of
visual and linguistic information are developing. Although it would seem that
not so long ago, entering text by voice was something in the realm of science
fiction or super high technology, now even a mid-level programmer can write
his own primitive language system. It seems that this is where the major
discoveries are happening right now. And I would very much like not just to
watch them from the sidelines, but to participate in these processes, to try my
hand, to learn from those who are already at the forefront of these
developments.
SMILES-2025, with its rich programme, lectures and international
context, is just the right environment where you can maximise your potential. I
am particularly close to the idea of the school as a space for real co-operation:
when you work not alone, but in a team, where everyone brings their
experience, their knowledge, their questions. I am sure that intercultural
interaction is not just a ‘nice bonus’, but one of the most powerful sources of
growth. Exchanging ideas with participants from [location] and other countries can
give a whole new perspective on familiar problems and open up unexpected
solutions.
What do I expect from the school? Firstly, a deep dive into cutting-edge
AI topics - from generative models and multimodality to LLM architecture and
multi-agent applications. I don't just want to ‘hear about them’, I want to work
hands-on, experiment, and try them out in practice. Secondly, I am looking
forward to the opportunity to communicate with mentors - people who not only
have a wealth of experience, but are willing to share it and think of something
new together. I want to ask questions, discuss possible career paths, understand
where and how I can apply my knowledge to the best advantage. Thirdly, I'm
looking forward to a lot of collaborative communication. Energy, ideas, joint
coding, discussions until the night - all the things for which I want to participate
in such projects.
As for my career plans, I see myself in the research and application field.
My goal is to continue to develop in the field of statistics and machine learning,
to deepen my understanding of both theoretical foundations and practical
applications. Also to improve my language level in order to be able to travel and
communicate with people of other cultures and other views on life.
But at the same time it is important for me to stay close to practice. I want
my research to be applicable - to be able to build it into a product, into a system,
into a solution that brings concrete benefits. I am inspired by examples where
AI technologies help doctors to make diagnoses, cities to manage traffic, and
companies to better understand their customers. I believe that the right
combination of statistics, ML and good engineering implementation is the key
to creating such solutions.
I really hope to have the opportunity to be part of SMILES-2025. As I am
ready to actively get involved, learn, share my knowledge, listen to others,
argue, propose ideas, participate in projects and do everything to make this
school not just an event in the calendar, but a real stage of growth - personal,
professional, research.
Thank you for your attention and for the opportunity to apply.
Sincerely, [surname]
