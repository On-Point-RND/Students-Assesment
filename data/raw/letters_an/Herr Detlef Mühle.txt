My parents are doctors who work with children whose diseases

are associated with a gene mutation. In the fourth grade, I discovered a new science - genetics, and a
[email] little later I became interested in machine learning.
At school, I actively participated in Olympiads, and
https://github.com/[name] also attended various courses and schools related to
the intersection of these two sciences. Therefore,
after enrolling in the university, the priority was
machine learning and the second was
bioinformatics. I have dreams, and I have ideas
related to high-tech development and research. I am
currently working in the bioinformatics laboratory
on a research project. It is important for me to study
right now, gain valuable experience and the
necessary knowledge for my further development in
this direction. Thanks for reading. Yours sincerely,
