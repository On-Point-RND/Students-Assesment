Dear Selection Committee,
I am [name], a doctoral student at [compaany] Doctoral School of Computer Science & [compaany], where I have the distinction of being the first and only student currently enrolled in this pioneering program. I am writing to express my keen interest in participating in the Skoltech Summer School on Machine Learning 2025.
My academic journey has been marked by consistent excellence, from my bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at [compaany] (GPA: 4.97/5) to my master's in Data Science at [compaany] (GPA: 9.25/10). These educational experiences have provided me with a solid foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical applications in computer science and machine learning.
Since November 2022, I have been working as a researcher at the Bayesian Methods Research Group, focusing on generative models for 3D data. Throughout this period, my research has evolved across several key projects, including exploration of the DreamFusion model for text-to-3D generation, development of the threestudio framework, and contribution to industrial projects on shadow generation and diffusion model acceleration. Most recently, I have specialized in texture synthesis, culminating in my paper "CasTex: Cascaded Text-to-Texture Synthesis via Explicit Texture Maps and Physically-Based Shading," which has been submitted to the ICCV conference (core A*).
I also like to share my knowledge. I have taught courses on “Text Analysis and Generative Models”, “Deep Learning”, and “3D Computer Vision” at [compaany], as well as “Deep Learning” at the New Economic School (NES). These experiences have enhanced my ability to communicate complex concepts clearly and would allow me to contribute meaningfully to group discussions and collaborative projects during the summer school.
Having previously attended SMILES-2024, I can attest to the value of this program. The experience significantly contributed to my professional development and helped me establish valuable connections within the AI research community. I am eager to build upon this foundation with the advanced content offered in the 2025 program, particularly in areas such as multimodal approaches, large language models, and multi-agent systems.
SMILES-2025 particularly appeals to me as its focus on generative AI methods directly aligns with my current research interests. I am also excited about the opportunity to collaborate with researchers from both [location] and [location].
I am confident that my strong academic background, research experience in generative AI make me an ideal candidate for SMILES-2025. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to this summer school.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name]
