Motivation Letter for Summer Schoo l in Machine Learning
Dear Selection Committee,
I am writing to express my sincere interest in participating in the Summer Schoo l in Machine
Learning. As a data scientiist and ML engineer with specialized experience in computer
vision and synthetic data generation, I am eager to further develop my skills and exchange
knowl edge with peers and experts in the field.
Motivation for Parti cipation
My journey in machine learning has been driven by a fascination with how AI can solve
complex real-wo rld problems. Working at the intersection of physics and machine learning
throug hout my academic and profes sional career has given me unique perspectives on
compu tational app roaches to challenging problems. My interest in machine learning
crystallized during my MSU master's thesis on predictive motion control for Auto nomous
Vehicles. This research revealed a critical challenge: the bottleneck of quality training data.
This insight led to developing a techno logy for proc edur al generation of synthetic datasets
using physically-based rendering. Our new app roach creates photorealistic training images
with perfect ground truth labels, precisely contr olling lighti ng, object variations, camera
positions, and enviro nmental factors. This innovation earne d recognition through a
competi tive R&D grant from FASIE.
The Summer Schoo l offers an opport unity to enhance this techno logy by engaging with
experts in generative models and simulation-based learning. I aim to explore advanced
domain randomization techniques and sim-to-real transfer methods while investigating ways
to reduce compu tational overhead without sacrificing photorealism.
Furthermore, as I prepare for doctoral studies at Skoltech, this Summer Schoo l would serve
as an excellent fo undation for my future research endea vors. The knowl edge gained and
connections made would be inva luable as I transition to more advanced academic work in the field.
Experience with ML/DL Tools
My experience with machine learning spans both academic research and in dustry
applications:
Synthetic Data Generation
As the lead deve loper and co-inventor of a custom system for proc edur al synthetic data
generation for computer vision models, I've gained deep experti se in creating photorealistic
training datasets using physically-based rendering techniques. This project, which won a
national R&D grant (application #С1ИИ-42828) from FASIE, aims to increase model
genera lizability and reduce dependence on real-wo rld data collection. The system has
proven va luable for industrial inspection, autonomous navigation, and pr ompt-based
computer vision systems.
Computer Vision Systems
I've deve loped several production-grade computer vision systems, including:
● A high-accuracy logo/mark recognition model for production lines (achieving over
99% precision)
● A pr ompt-based object segm entation and detection pipeline with a public
demo nstration via Telegram (@RapidVisionBot)
● Prototype autonomous systems for dynamic enviro nments as part of my master's
research
Technical Toolkit
I am profi cient in:
● Progr amming lan guages: Python, MATLAB, C/C++, SQL
● ML/DL frameworks: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, HugginGface
● CV tools: OpenCV, Torchvision, Ultralytics
● Data infrastructure: Spark, Hive, Airflow, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker
Expecta tions from the Summer Schoo l
From this Summer Schoo l, I hope to:
1. Deepen my theor etical understanding: While I have practical experience
implem enting ML systems, I aim to strengthen my grasp of the unde rlying
mathematical fo undations that power modern deep learning ar chitectures.
2. Explore emerging techniques: I'm particularly interested in learning about the latest
advancements in few-shot learning, self-supervis ed learning, and multi-modal
systems that combi ne vision and lan guage.
3. Expand my ne twork: Bui lding connections with researchers and practitioners who
share similar interests would provide opport unities for future colla boration and
knowl edge exchange.
4. Refi ne my research direction: As I prepare for doctoral studies, I hope the Summer
Schoo l will help me identi fy compelling research questions at the intersection of
synthetic data generation and computer vision that I can pursue in my future
academic work.
5. Share my experti se: I look fo rward to contributing my experience in synthetic data
generation and physically-based rendering to discussions and colla borative projects
during the program.
Career Plans
My career trajec tory is focused on advancing the field of computer vision through inn ovative
app roaches to data generation and model training. In the imm edi ate term, I plan to:
1. Continue developing my research in proc edur al generation of synthetic datasets, with
a goal of publi shing fi ndi ngs in prominent ML conferences.
2. Pursue doctoral studies at Skoltech, focusing on computer vision and
simulation-based machine learning app roaches.
3. Bridge academic research with practical applications by maintaining involvement in
real-wo rld ML projects through my work at Rapid Vision.
In the longer term, I aspire to:
1. Lead research initia tives that combi ne physics-based simulation with modern deep
learning to solve complex perception problems in autonomous systems.
2. Contribute to the demo cratization of computer vision techno logy by developing tools
that reduce data dependencies and enable more efficient model training.
3. Foster colla boration between academic institutions and industry par tners to ensure
research advancements translate into practical solutions.
The Summer Schoo l in Machine Learning would be a pivotal step in this journey, providing
essen tial knowl edge, skills, and connections that will help me achieve these goals. The
program's emphasis on both theor etical fo undations and practical applications aligns
perf ectly with my app roach to the field.
Thank you for conside ring my application. I am excited about the pos sibility of participating in
this exceptional learning opport unity and contributing to the vibrant community of machine
learning researchers and practitioners.
Sincerely, Egor Korovko
