Hello,
My name is [name] [surname], and I am eager to participate in your scientific schoo, hopeful that
my age will not be a barrier. My research has long been centered on artificial neural netwoks,
albeit from a deeply theoretical perspective, somewhat removed from practical applications.
Inspired by the remarkable successes of machine learning across various domains—science,
industry, and economics—I am motivated to shift my focus toward more application-driven neural
network research.
I am drawn to this Schoo because it offers a unique opportunity to immerse myself in cutting-edg
machine learning topics and to connect with a vibrant community of both fundamental thinkers and
practitioners who apply ML methods to real-world industrial and applied research challenges. This
blend of practical orientation and foundational science perfectly aligns with my aspirations. I am
eager to embrace this approach in my future work, and I believe the Schoo is the ideal place to
help me chart the right path forward.
My academic background is rooted in nonlinear physics, specifically in the nonlinear dynamics of
complex active networks. I was trained at the [compaany] Faculty of [location], graduating from the
Department of Oscillation and Automatic Regulation Theory.
During my PhD at the [compaany], I
investigated synchronization and chaos phenomena in oscillatory and neuron-like active elements
—a field at the crossroaads of nonlinear dynamics and computational neuroscience. More recentlly, I
have gradually steered my nonlinear dynamics expertise toward machine learning-related areas,
particularly reservoir computing.
I believe my experience, especially my computaional neuroscience perspective on spiking neural
networks combiined with a dynamical systems approach to recurrent neural networks, can offer
valuable insights and enrich traditional machine learning practices. Participating in this Schoo
will
empower me to deepen my understanding, expand my skills, and contribute meaningfully to this
exciting, rapidlly evolving field.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to learn, collaborate,
and grow within this inspiring community.
