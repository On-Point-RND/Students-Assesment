What is Optimal Transport?
Image Examples
Monge’s Formulation of
Optimal Transport
Kantorovich’s Formulation of
Optimal Transport
If distributions are continuous
Kantorovich’s OT plan and Monge’s
OT map are equal
This provides deterministic OT plan
What is Entropic Optimal
Transport and
How it provides Stochastic OT
plan?
Formulation of Entropic
Optimal Transport
Dual formulation of EOT
Schrodinger Bridge problem Dynamic OT problem
ENOT method
Our Method
Our method
•
Propose one-step stochastic generator G to sample X_t
•
Optimize G using correspondiing f (connected with FP equation)
•
Use discriminator to obtain target distribution (as in ENOT method)
Toy experiments
MNIST experiments
gamma=0.0 gamma=1.0 gamma=10.0
Celeba-HQ experiments
Samples from generator (gamma=1.0) Samples on trajectories (gamma=1.0)
Conclusion
• Scalable and efficient solution EOT problem
• Built on rigorous OT theory
• Easily controls stochasticity
• Applicable to unpaired translation problems
Future research
• Apply method for more high dimensional problems
• Compaare with existing EOT methods [5-8]
