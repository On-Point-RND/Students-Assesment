Pepper Ripeness and Size Classification Using ML/DL: Challenges and Future Directions

Introduction

Automated classification of peppers by size (large/small) and ripeness stage (fully/half ripened, green) using ML/DL.
Critical for precision agriculture optimizes harvesting, reduces waste, and improves yield.
Manual inspection is labor-intensive and error-prone.

Problem statement

In line with global trends toward enhancing production safety and efficiency, the agricultural sector is rapidly adopting digital technologies. A key focus is the automation of monitoring systems for greenhouse complexes, where the cultivation of tall crops demands continuous oversight to minimize risks of yield loss.
Goal of the Intelligent Control System
Develop an AI-driven monitoring system using computer vision and machine learning to:
Automate real-time cultivation tracking.
Reduce labor dependency, cutting workforce needs by 40-50%.
Achieve 95% accuracy in anomaly detection (diseases, pests, growth irregularities).

Reducing crop losses by 15-25% will boost greenhouse profitability.
Early issue identification minimizes pesticide use and resource waste (water, energy).
Supports global AgriTech digitization trends and lowers environmental footprint.

Methods

YOLOv8 (object detection + classification) pretrained on COCO, fine-tuned on tomato dataset used Kaggle datasets and custom pepper dataset on real data in agroenvironment. YOLo balances speed and accuracy, ideal solution for real-time (online) agricultural applications.
Detects pepper and classifies them into 6 categories using bounding box regression and convolutional features.
Pretrain on dataset with 2 classes, fine-tuned on 6 classes (size + ripeness) and augmented

Results

High detection accuracy: mAP50 = 0.83, precision = 0.82
Classification weakness: Validation cls_loss (0.37) is double the training loss (0.19)
Recal_l = 0.78: Misses small/occluded pepper
Intellectual property
3 software
2 database
2 patents

Research gap

Unresolved Challenges:
Handling lighting variations and occlusions.
Improving generalization without excessive labeling.

Future Opportunities
Generate diverse pepper and tomato images for class balancing based on LLM/VLM.
Separate detection and classification tasks for specialization.
Optimize for real-time use in agricultural robots.
