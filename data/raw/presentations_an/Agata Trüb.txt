Introduction and terminology
Physics of projections formation: From projection space to
reco[surname]ruction space:
reco[surname]ruction

Motivation and task description
Problem: CT projections data take lots of storage
Task: develop an approa[surname]h for compression of
raw projections with least loss
Motivation:
● reduce total storage
● increase transfer of projections data
● con[surname]ider data compression in terms of

applications to specific medical task and
propo[surname]e a novel semantic compression

approach
Typical helical sscanning:
~10⁴-10⁵ images of shape (736,64) of dtype
uint16 => several Gb storage

Aim and goals
Aim: propo[surname]e a me[surname]hod for problem of semantic projection-space CT
compression, con[surname]idering specific medical task solution for
reco[surname]onstru[surname]tion domain (on example of semantic lung compression)
Goa[surname]s:
● research exis[surname]ting methods for image compression
● develop an efficient neural pipeline for projections compression
● propo[surname]e novel me[surname]hod for solution of problem of semantic
compression
Poten[surname]ial i[surname]pact: application to clinical use

Methods (Image compression)
Idea: con[surname]ider projections as separate images and create latent representation
Image compression approa[surname]h: VQ-VAE

Methods (Video compression)
Idea: con[surname]ider patches of consequent frames
Ar[surname]itecture: DVC

Ideas of improvement for semantic compression
Idea: while training check not o[surname]ly projections domain but also reconstruction domain
Rea[surname]ization: reconstruction libraries
Table 1. Co[surname]parison of reconstruction approa[surname]ches
Drawback of torch-radon could be avoided by introducing of
re[surname]inning function (conebeam -> fanbeam)
Conc[surname]ion: use in experiments torch-radon + re[surname]inning

Semantic compression
Idea: at the same level of compression retu[surname] more qualitative lung reconstruction
Approa[surname]h: novel pipeline with adding DICE loss to training proce[surname]ure
Rea[surname]ization:

Fig 10. Propo[surname]ed scheme of DICE loss incorp[surname]oration
Semantic compression re[surname]ults (DICE Loss)
DICE score on unc[surname]ompressed projections: 81.98%
Baseline compressor propo[surname]ed: DICE*0.2 propo[surname]ed: DICE*0.5+Reco[surname]_MSE*2
Conc[surname]ion for
propo[surname]ed loss:
● better contours
● higher DICE
● lost both image
and projections
quality

Semantic compression (mask loss)
Idea: at the same level of compression retu[surname] more qualitative lung reconstruction
Approa[surname]h: novel pipeline with adding MSE loss between lungs to training proce[surname]ure
Rea[surname]ization:

Fig 11. Propo[surname]ed scheme of MASK loss incorp[surname]oration
Semantic compression re[surname]ults (mask loss)
Baseline propo[surname]ed: MASK*0.1 proposed: MASK*0.3
Baseline re[surname]ults (without additional
losses):
Conc[surname]ion for proposed loss:
● better internal lung reconstruction
● higher DICE VS baseline, but lower VS Dice Loss
Mask loss validation
Training details: 5-fold cross validation on 1744 sinograms dataset
Conc[surname]ion: for proposed model in trade-o[surname] between DICE and image quality (PSNR) for the same
image quality our model achieves higher DICE score

Conc[surname]ions and discussion
● Con[surname]idered classical and neural methods for image and video
compression
● Propo[surname]ed a novel approa[surname]h for projections compression
● Re[surname]on[surname]sidered compression task in terms of semantic
compression
● Suggested loss function (DICE loss, Mask Loss) for semantic compression
● Re[surname]ults and deve[surname]opment of approa[surname]ch may be interesting from
both research and clinical use points of view
