Challenges of
factor models
Traditional models (CAPM, Fama-French) Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio:
assume: Financial markets are inherently noisy.
Linearity in factor relationships. True signals are weak and difficult to
Stationary market conditions. isolate.
Machine Learning (ML) introduces: Regime Shifts:
Nonlinear modeling capacity. Market behavior changes over time.
Data-driven factor discovery. Static models fail to adapt to new
Potential for higher predictive accuracy. regimes.
Interpretability and Robustness:
Deep models are often black boxes.
How can we build adaptive, interpretable,
and accurate factor models that survive
noise and adjust to market shifts?

Conclusion
Future possible extensions:
Modern factor models combine deep
learning with financial theory to improve
stock return prediction
Combine FactorVAE’s uncertainty
estimation with HireVAE’s regime
switching.
Each model targets specific challenges:
Noise in financial data → FactorVAE
Hidden nonlinear relationships → FactorGCL
Changing market regimes → HireVAE
