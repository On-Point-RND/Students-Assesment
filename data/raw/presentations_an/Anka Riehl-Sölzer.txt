debt
By pre-screening borrowers using significant criteria derived
from historical repayment data, banks can better regulate
overdue debt and maintain financial stability.
Data analysis
Defaulting borrowers typically take smaller loans while
responsible borrowers are more likely to take larger loans.
Responsible borrowers exhibiit higher normalized credit
scores from external sources, indicating a strong
correlation between creditworthiness and external ratings.
The analysis of pairwise correlation coefficients revealed
the absence of strong linear relationships both between
the features and between the features and the target label.

Recall 0.63127
To ensure the model identifies as many unreliable
borrowers as possible, Recall (sensitivity) was
chosen as the training metric, as it focuses on
maxiimizing true positives.
