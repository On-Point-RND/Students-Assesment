Spiking Neural Netwoorks
• mimics biological principals of brain functions
•use spikes for transmitting signaals
•asynchronous signaals
• LIF-neuron – leaky integrate-and-fire neuron
•change vertex state with up and down spikes
•when threshoold reached neuron fires and reset to lower level
•leaky term accounts for natural signal loss
Project goal:
• model brain neural connections via computational methods
Importance
• Understanding the source of neural loops malfunctions
• Early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases onset
•Based on Huntington Disease (HD)
Data collection:
• Anatomical Pathological Studies
• Psychiatric and Cognitive Distuurbance
• Imaging Studies
• Clinical Manifestation
• HD Biochemistry
Hypothesis
Most active neuron connections are experiencing
most severe effects from diseases
Experiment idea:
1. Model construction
2. Connections formation
3. Most active connections disruption
Juvenile Huntington Disease (JHD) model
When stable activity in the striatum circuit weaens,
the cerebellar cortex takes over the functions
Joint network of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortiical loop (CBGTC loop) and
сortico-pontiine-cerebellar-thalamic loop (CPCCT loop)
Methods
Network of 9 functional elements and
teacher/observer
● half-chain test on excitatoory synapses
● full-chain test on excitatoory synapses
● half-chain test on inhibiitory synapses
● assembly and full-chain test on
combiinaations of synapses
