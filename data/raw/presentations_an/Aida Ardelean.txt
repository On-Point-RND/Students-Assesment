Generative Molecular Design for Medicinal Chemistry Using AI Platform FREED++

Slide 2
----------------------------------------
Introduction

In June 2023, [compaany]'s drug INS018_055, designed to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, became the first drug entirely discovered and designed by AI to reach phase 2 clinical trials.
The company also has two other drugs in clinical trials that were partially created using AI:
For the treatment of CCOVID-19
For the treatment of solid tumors

Drug discovery

Classical approach
7-10 years

Using AI
from 18 months

Drug

Our goal is to develop an AI-driven platform to generate novel drug candidates optimized for therapeutic efficacy, intellectual property potential, and manufacturability.

Slide 3
----------------------------------------
Problem statement

Traditional drug discovery is time-consuming and inefficient. Existing AI models often neglect patentability and synthesizability.
Our Solution: A generative AI model (FREED++) that simultaneously optimizes:
 Affinity using AutoDock Vina + ML-based pharmacophore analysis.
 Patentability using patent database screening (collaboration with [compaany]).
 Synthesizability using retrosynthetic accessibility prediction.
 Toxicity?

Main focus on ERα antagonists for hormone-dependent cancers, but can be adapted for other projects.

Slide 5
----------------------------------------
Methods

Why FREED++?
Possibility of setting the starting molecular fragment based on the company's requirements
Can combine molecular docking, ML, patent data analysis in one pipeline
Flexible reward function

Slide 6
----------------------------------------
Results

Generated 1,000 novel molecules, with Top-10 ranked by QED (drug-likeness) and DockingScore.
Zero overlap with PubChem (Top-100 molecules), ensuring patentability.
Molecules sent to [compaany] for experimental testing.

Metrics:
Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness.
DockingScore (Binding affinity to ERα PDB: 1ERE)
Patentability (in progress)

Slide 7
----------------------------------------
Research gap

Current Limitations at hand:
Limited integration of ADME/Tox data (e.g., CYP450 inhibition, hERG cardiotoxicity).
Scalability issues with large datasets (>1.5M molecules).
Adaptation of the model for simultaneous calculation of all scaffolds, and not 50 per batch

Our molecules could be too toxic, already patented, or both. It Matters, because the goal is a drug, not a lawsuit with side effects.
Future Opportunity is to implement multimodal AI (diffusion models + LLLMs) for enhanced generative accuracy.
