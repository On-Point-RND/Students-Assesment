Problem formulation
Task
/01 Phase Exploratory analysis
 Development of a generative model  Identification of optimal descriptors;
 Development of a predictive model
capable of producing molecules with
enhanced antioxidant properties
/02 Phase Generative model development
 Development of a generative model;
 Design of reward functions for alignment
 Design of a candidate selection filte
/03 Phase Molecules validation
 Validation of molecules using a 'hidden' function
 Selection of new 'seed' molecules for generation

Reward function
• Cycle complexity
• LogP
• SA
• BertzCT (Ipc is too computationally intensive)
• Penalty for non-phenolic and non-amine structures
• Penalty for large non-branching aliphatic radicals
• Cutoff based on the final property
Reward
λ*(Сycle complexity + LogP + SA + BertzCT + Штрафы) – cuttoff
λ = 1 – amine
λ = 5 – phenol
