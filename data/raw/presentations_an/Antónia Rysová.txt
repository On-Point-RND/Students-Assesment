Introduction
• Human genome is functionally “heterogeneous”: 10% of DNA encodes proteins (aka сoding DNA sequence, CDS), while the rest plays regulatory role (non-coding DNA, ncDNA)
• 80-90% of genomic variants associated with hereditary diseases and tumors are located in non-coding
regions of the genome
• Yet, the prediction of the effect of mutation in non-coding regions remaiins a challenge
• The goal of my work was to fine-tune state-of-the-art models to improve such predictions
Introduction
The most widely used tool, CADD, predicts SNP
pathogenicity based on evolutionary conservation
(assuming mutations preserved since
human-chimpanzee divergence are benign).
CADD incorporates multiple data types:
Conservation metrics (GERP, phastCons, phyloP)
●
DNase accessibility
●
Transcription factor binding sites
●
Distance to exon-intron boundaries
●
Expression levels
●
Introduction
Legnet ([autosome.org]) is a CNN model that takes a DNA sequence as input and predicts its
regulatory activity. Thus, it is not directly predicting the pathogenicity, but rather assumes that
significant activity alteration would result in disbalance and probably disease.
Problem statement
• State-of-the-art models like transformer-based Enformer or LegNet (CNN) often overlook the effects of
single-nucleotide mutations, despite their critical role in disease development.
• My goal is to train neural networks on personalized genomes to address this limitation and make such
models applicable for personalized medicine.
Methods
In [1] authors compared multi-task and single-task models for tissue-specific predictions and
concluded that multitask ones tend to “overgeneralize” signaals in different cell lines.
Besides, we chose single-task LegNet insteaad of multi-task Enformer to make it more applicable in
real-life: the predictions with LegNet can be performeed on CPU and take much less time (hours
rather than days for Enformer)

Methods
In CAGE (experiment type used to measure gene activity) data follows ~log-normal distributions with
a few extreme outliers (highly active genes) => we applied log transformation

Genes located nearby on the same chromosome tend to have same activity patterns. To
exclude data leakage we used chromosome-stratified train-test split
Fine-tuning
Default Configuration:
● ef_block_sizes = [80, 96, 112,
128]
● pool_sizes = [2, 2, 2, 2]
→ 4 blocks, moderate capacity
Fine-tuned:
● ef_block_sizes = [80, 96, 112,
128, 256, 512]
● pool_sizes = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
→ 6 blocks, expanded feature
learning
Key Improvements:
● Deeper network
● Larger receptive field
● Enhanced pattern detection
Methods
VCF annotation tool
VCF is a file format, containing information about mutations. We developed a VCF-processing
tool utilizing optimized LegNet models to predict mutation effects.
Genomic Region Selection
● Initial intuition suggested analyzing sequences near the begiinnning of a gene
● However, there are other types of regulatory elements (enhancers) that may be distal from
the gene
● Consequentlly, we implemented user-selectable region options: centering around the mutation
and the gene start
Methods
VCF annotation tool
Mutation Scope
● Option A: Evaluate all mutations within a genomic window (captures combinatorial effects)
● Option B: Focus on individual SNVs (enables precise variant interpretation)
Results
• We were unable to outperform Clipnet on MPRA data
• Training on CAGE data yielded better results compared to PRO-Cap experiments
• Model performance showed strong dependence on dataset size, with the smallesst dataset (HepG2)
exhibiiting the lowest predictive accuracy.
Research gap
• We have yet to outppeform ClipNet on PRO-Cap datasets
• We plan to evaluaate our model on additional genomic datasets (ADASTRA and UDACCHA) to assess its
generalizability
• Small datasets provide insufficient signal for robusst training. Given the high cost of biologicaal data
generation, it is a serious restriction.
• The current receptive field cannot capture distal genomic interactions. Since many regulatory elements
(e.g., enhancers) are located >1kb from their target genes, expanding this window should significantlly
improve prediction accuracy
