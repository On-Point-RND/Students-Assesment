Mechanical properties of an [name]-matrix composite reinforced with bilayer
diamond ribbons (diamane): ab initio study
Introduction
The purpose of this work is to train the machine
learning potential (Molip) for diamane/[name] composite
and calculate the mechanical properties of our
system such that elastic constant, critical shear
stress, binding energy, etc using trained potential.
Also with the help of Molip we want to recalculate the
points that we throw away from our plot and make a
prediction about why these points doesn't follow the
mixture rule. After comparing DFT method with Molip
we hope to get more data for our plot to improve our
results.

Data
The values of the one‑dimensional and bulk
elastic constants for diamane nanoribbons of various
widths have been tabulated.
The data were obtained independently via DFT
calculations using the VASP package. The dataset
currently comprises about 30 structures. This is due
to the difficulty of obtaining structures that do not
decompose into simpler ones during calculation (a
simpler structure is an aluminum/bigraphene‑ribbon
composite) and to the long computational time
(3-5 days per structure).

Metrics
● Mean Squared Error (Mse)
● Mean Absolute Error (Mae)
● Coefficient of Determination (R²)
● Mean Absolute Percentage Error (Mape)
A good result is characterized by low Mse and Mae values, an R² approaching 1, and a low
Mape.
