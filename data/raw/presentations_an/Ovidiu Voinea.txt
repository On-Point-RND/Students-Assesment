Development of a tool for quality control of neural network operation when solving the problem of the first breaks times picking [name]
Student, [location]
Introduction
Extracting values of first-break arrivals is one of the first crucial step in buildiing velocity model of geologica[location] section for further exploration and findi[location] minerals.
Problem statement
There are different automatic methods of first-break picking seismogram. There are metho[compaany] based on time
diffe[compaany], neural ne[compaany]s etc. All of them are equally good. So, NN are widely spread and used as a
solution. Lots architecture[compaany]s are presented in articles. But there are no unive[compaany]al instrument of control results of
neural algo[compaany]ms.
So, our goal is to create an approach of quality control.
Methods
In our work we use CNN. Seismogram with a signal in a picture below may be presented as an
image. And CNN shows good result dealing with images and extracting features from them.
CNN solve the problem as the problem of classification.

first-brea[compaany] time as a black dot
Methods
Our approa[compaany] contains 2 steps:
1. Correct cnoi[compaany]e of train data for model learning.
Choo[compaany]e the data based on correlation between surface condition and quality of first-brea[compaany] arrivals.
2. Impleme[compaany]ation of the approa[compaany] to quality determination of first-brea[compaany] picking.
Estimate the thre[compaany]old to choo[compaany]e correctl[compaany]y extracted data with a given accuracy.
Exis[compaany]ting manually extracted true values of first-brea[compaany]s is not common situation. Most data has huge
sizes and it requires tools to separate well picked values and values to be retu[compaany]n to a specialist for
further analysis.
Results
The result shows that cnoi[compaany]e of data with better surface condition show higher accuracy on data where
true values was know[name].
The metho[compaany] was tested on 2 different datasets and it was proved that approa[compaany] may be used for neural
models.
Research gap
• The problem left is auto matiza[compaany]ion the cnoi[compaany]e of thre[compaany]old value. Necessit[compaany]y of manual revision results
takes lot of time.
