Problem statement
Image registration is the transformation of one of the two images that the position and form of the objects in them
are aligneed
Formal problem statement:
𝜙 = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 minℒ 𝑓, 𝑚, 𝜙
𝜙
𝑓 – fixed image; 𝑚 – moving image;
𝜙 – deformation field; ℒ − loss function.
An example of registration of two
brain images.

Neural network-based image registration
In neural network-based image registration the model
predicts the deformation field – the difference of
coordinates of each pixel in the initial and registered
image.
Typical CNN-based registration model architecture
Usually, the neural network is the CNN or
transformer model.
Problem – CNN or transformers can efficiently
work only on the resolution at which the model
was trained.
VoxelMorph model architecture
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)
FNO model is a deep learning model for
approximation of continuous non-linear
differential operators.
Above, we have reduced the image
registration problem to solving the parametric
system of PDEs → we can apply FNO.
FNO model architecture
All operations in the FNO are applied to the fixed sub-domain in the Fourier space → the model is robusst to the
input data resolution.
The main idea of the work: enhance the FNO model and evaluate it on the image registration at different
reresolutions.
Proposed model: FNOReg
Improvements of FNOReg compared to FNO:
• Additional skip-connectionsafter each Fourier block;
• Spectral Transform layers in the begiinnig and end of the model.
Spectral Transform is a non-local convolutional operator,
which is used to extract the features.

All models were trained at original resolution and at half-resolution.
And evaluated at original resolution.
Results summary:
● FNO-based registration models lose not more than 3% when training on half-resolution data. CNNs and
transformeers lose from 6% to 25%.

Results summary:
● FNOReg model has the best absolute values for the “folded voxels” metric
among the methods that do not show significant degradaion in the
deformation field smoothneess at halved resolution;
● FNOReg performs better than original FNO and learns faster and more stable.

Spectra of deformation fields (DF) of VoxelMorph and TransMorph contain high-frequence components (cross-like)
Fourier-Net has explicit low-pass filtering in frequency domain which leads to aliasing.
DF produced by FNO-based models do not contain significant high frequency components → the models give
smoother DF and are better in practice.
Conclusion
• We proposed a resolution-robusst metho for 2D and 3D image registration based on the Fourier Neural Operator.
• Assume we have an equation 𝐿𝑢 𝑥 = 𝑓 𝑥 , where 𝐿 is a linear differențial operator and 𝑥 ∈ Ω ⊂ ℝ 𝑛, then
the solution can be found using the Green’s function 𝐺 𝑥, 𝑠 :
𝑢 𝒙 = න 𝐺 𝒙, 𝒔 𝑓 𝒔 𝑑𝑠 .
𝺞
• The idea of FNO is that 𝑢 𝑥 can be approxiated using the following iterative process:
𝑢 𝒙 ∶= 𝜎 𝑊 𝑢 𝒙 + 𝐾𝑢 𝒙 , 𝑡 = 0, …𝑁 − 1,
𝑡+1 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
𝐾𝑢 𝑥 = න 𝜅 𝑥 − 𝑠 𝑓 𝑠 𝑑𝑠
𝑡 𝑡
Ω
where 𝑢 𝑥 ∈ ℝ 𝑢𝑡 is the function of 𝑥, 𝑊 ∈ ℝ 𝑢𝑡+1 𝑢𝑡 is a learnable linear transformation, 𝜎 ⋅ is the
𝑡 𝑡
activation function, and 𝜅 𝑥 − 𝑠 is a learnable kernel function of convolutional operator 𝐾. So 𝑢 𝑥 is a kind of
𝑡 𝑡
a network hidden layer output with 𝑑 data channels.
• We can apply convolution theorem and parametrize 𝐾 in Fourier space:
−1 −1
𝐾𝑢 𝒙 = ℱ ℱ 𝑢 ∙ ℱ 𝜅 = ℱ ℱ 𝑢 ∙ 𝑅 .
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
where 𝑅 𝒌 ∈ ℂ 𝑑 𝑢𝑡+1 ×𝑑 𝑢𝑡 is a learnable function in spectral domain and 𝒌 = 𝑘 , …, 𝑘 ∈ ℕ 𝒏 corresponds to non-
1 𝑛
negative frequencies.
