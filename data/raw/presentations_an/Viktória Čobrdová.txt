Image segmentation in the
near infrared range of the
spectrum for selection of
a charcoal sketch under
the paint layer of paintings

The relevance of the issue
Sketches can be used to estimate the
originality of a work and analyze the
author's artistic style. This is achieved
through the recognition of:
compositional changes,
partially erased inscriptions and
signatures,
preparatory drawings and scale grids.

Aim and objectives
Aim
To research image segmentation methods and develop approaches for the automatic selection
of sketch lines on the near infrared paintings scan.
Objectives:
1. Explore existing image segmentation approaches and evaluate their applicability as foundational
for the developed method.
2. Prepare a dataset that includes original images along with their correspondiing binary masks.
3. Develop new segmentation method and test it on sample images.
4. Optimize the segmentation method to enhance its accuracy.
Existing approaches
The main methods and algorithms for selecting objects:
threshold segmentation (global binarization, adaptive
binarization, Otsu method);
region-based methods (watershed method);
bounary-based image segmentation methods (Sobel
operator, Canny operator);
clusterization-based methods (K-means clustering);
segmentation using neural networks (convolutional
neural networks, transformer networks).

Comparison of basic
methods
Classical methods: Neural Networks (NN):
manual adjustment for each image; automatic learning;
simple implementaion; more efficient segmentation of complex
scenes or objects with thin borders;
designed for specific types of tasks.
easy adaptation to different types of tasks.
Comparison of NN
architectures
Convolutional NN: Transformeer NN:
the convolution operation allows extraction long dependencies between pixels;
of local features from images;
uses an attention mecaniism that allows to
still used at international competitions focus on the most important areas of the image,
in image segmentation; ignoring less important ones;
it has become a basic solution. allows variable sizes of input data.

Future opportunities
Future plans:
increase the dataset;
explore other algorithm for processing input images;
consider new approaches to image segmentation.
Risks and challenges:
low technical power for complex tasks (neural network training);
the human factor in creating image masks.
