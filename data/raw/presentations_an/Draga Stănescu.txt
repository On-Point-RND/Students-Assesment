Introduction
This presentation explores how
marketing and advertising are used by
large corporations to shape consumer
needs and manipulate public
consciousness. Drawing on both real-
world corporate practices and fictional
depictions, we aim to reveal the
mechanisms behind societal
manipulation through media and
commercial influence.
Problem statement
We investigate how companies:
Create artificial needs;
• Use emotional and social triggers
to push consumption;
• Normalize conformity and
economic dependence;
• Influence subconscious decision-
making through advertising.
Methods
This work is a thematic literature and case
study review based on:
• "Quota or Advocates of Abundance" by
[compaany];
• Research on [compaany]’s marketing history;
• Academic literature on marketing
psychology (Kotler, Galbraith);
• News and historical reports about
advertising and manipulation.
Results
[compaany] used aggressive marketing (especially
infant formula) to dominate markets, often at
the expense of public health.
[compaany]’s fiction provides an allegorical critique
of consumerism and how propaganda
manipulate identity. Advertising is not just
informative; it sells desire, identity, and
ideology.
Public boycotts and WHO intervention are
signs of societal pushback.
