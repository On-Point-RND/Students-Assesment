Classification of single-cannel ECG signaals using a hybrid transformer archtecture and KAN

Introduction

ECG signal processing can solve many 
problems related to the heart.
Modern models have achieved great success, but 
wearable devices still do not have time to grow 
behind them and have too few resources to launch.

Problem statement

Are modern models really big?
Is it possible to reduce the size of the models without
losing accuracy?
What new approaches can be applied to
achieve our goals?

Methods

Auto encoder system → Transformer(MLP) → Transformer(KAN)
The key idea is that these archtectures work better with context and 
require fewer parameters. At the same time, 
the accuracy is many times higher.
These models pay more attention to the 
long-range context and adapt better to 
the data.
Smote for augmentation dataset +
MIT-BIH arrhythmia database 

Results

Current solutions have 35 times fewer parameters, than SOTA model at current. 
It doesn't work much worse than the SOTA model.
The compiled model can be used even in weaк microcontrollers.

Research gap

In some places, the quality has dropped.
Data is still scarce, even after augmentation
Need to use other datasets and a different NN archtecture.
