Problem Statement
• Routing congestion is the ratio of
routed wires to available routing
tracks within a specific area (e.g.,
a grid square).
• A higher congestion value
indicates a more difficult routing
situation and may lead to design
rule violations or failed routing.

Importance of Early Congestion
Estimation
Floorplan
• The ability to estimate routing
congestion early in the design flow
Placement
allows engineers to adjust the layout
— such as cell placement — to
mitigate problematic areas in Routing
advance.
• This can significantly reduce the Physical
Verification
number of EDA tool iterations and
decrease total design time.

Overview of Existing Approaches
• Routing congestion prediction has been addressed using classical
machine learning and deep learning models:
– Gradient Boosting
– Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
– Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
– Generative models (e.g., U-Net)
• Most existing approaches rely on post-placement features
• Initial layout parameters (e.g., core utilization, power grid, number of
metal layers) are typically not taken into account, despite their significant
influence on routability.

Conclusions
• The proposed approach allows estimating routing congestion
without performiing the routing stage.
• Initial layout parameters significantlly affect both congestion
and prediction accuracy.
• The main challenge lies in choosing an appropriate data split
strategy for training and testing.
• Future work includes expanding the dataset by a factor of
50–100.
