Phone: +2 *** *** ***
Motivation:
I am a graduaate of [university] with a strong background
in economics and mathematical methods. My academic path included rigorous
training in quantitative analysis, modeling, and statistics.
Recentlly, I have focused on developing skills in machine learning and AI.
I studied Python, neural networks, and generative models, and I am fascinated
by the power of large language models and multi-agent systems.
SMILES-2025 represents a unique opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience
and collaborate with international researchers. I believe my mathematical
foundation and growing ML experience will allow me to contribute meaningfully.
I am especially interested in the practical application of generative methods
and the chance to participate in real-world challenges and industry-level projects.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
