1. Review-articles were prepared on modern RAG- and GraphRAG-methods for conditional text generation tasks.  
2. PersonalAI-library (github-repository might be private, but it will be published in 1-2 months) has been developed with functionality for constructing a knowledge graph and performing searches in order to solve QA-tasks.  
3. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the quality of the implemented methods on the DiaASQ-dataset.  
4. Further research was formulated.  

5.1 Further research plan  
1. Conduct ablation to compare proposed methods with existing RAG- and GraphRAG-methods:  
1.1. datasets: TriviaQA, HotpotQA;  
1.2. LLMs: QWEN2.5 7B, DeepSeek R1 7B.  
2. Implement a method for searching information in a graph, based on a multi-agent pipeline with iterative information-collection and refinement of the search-plan.  
3. Implement a method for generating clarifying questions (Multi-turn QA) for search-plan adjustments by the user.  
4. Formulate recommendations/template for developing task-oriented dialogue systems.  
Based on the obtained results, it is planned to make reports at two student conferences: “XIV Congress of Young Scientists of [Location]” and “77th All-Russian (with international participation) scientific conference of students and young scientists of [Location]”. Two articles will also be prepared (preprints in May) with colleagues from [Company] AI and [Company] AI at the [Company] (A*) and [Company] (A*) conferences.
