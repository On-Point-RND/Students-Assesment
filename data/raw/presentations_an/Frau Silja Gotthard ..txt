Slide 2
----------------------------------------
Air humidity is a key climate parameter that influences climate and atmospheric dynamics
Humidity measurements are sparse in space and time, especially in the early 20th cenntury
Data on other meteorological variables are more readily available
Relevance and problem


Slide 3
----------------------------------------
Data recovery will extend climate series and improve the accuracy of climate change analysis
Existing restaurant methods are not effective – never approaches are needed


Relevance and problem


Slide 4
----------------------------------------
The purpose and objectives of the study
Objective: To retrospectively reconstruct the relative humidity measurement series over the ocean
Tasks:
forming a data collection for training and evaluating models
optimization of algorithm and restoration of humidity
evaluation of the quality of models and their comparison
analysis of spatial maps of model errors


Slide 5
----------------------------------------
Data
relative humidity
Target:
Data source: DISO3 (Dataset of In-Situ Observations over the Ocean)
Coverage period: 1950-2017 (123 million observations)
Training set: 70% of data
Test set: 30% of data

Data are pre-standardized
Gaps are filled with values ​​generated from a normal distribution


Slide 6
----------------------------------------
Solution method
Machine learning models have been tested:
linear regression (simplicity and interpretability, basic model for comparison)
random forest (high accuracy, resistance to overfitting, consideration of feature interactions)
gradient boosting (high accuracy, automatic processing of categorical features)
fully connected artificial neural network (ability to model complex dependencies, nonlinearity)

Increased spatial and temporal specificity: data is divided into squares of 5x5 degrees in latitude and longitude (10x20 degrees in the Southern Ocean) each square is analyzed separately within each season


Slide 7
----------------------------------------
Stages of solving the problem
1
Model quality assessment:
quantitative assessment (RMSE)
uncertainty assessment (bootstrap)
comparison with a trivial model (averaging humidity over a region)
2
3
Hyperparameter optimization:
used optuna Bayesian optimization library
4
Analysis of spatial distribution of accuracy:
1) construction of spatial error maps
2) their comparison with maps of climatic characteristics
Model training:
-linear regression
-random forest
-fully connected neural network
-gradient boosting


Slide 8
----------------------------------------
Results: Trivial model


Slide 9
----------------------------------------
Results: Linear Regression


Slide 10
----------------------------------------
Results: Random Forest


Slide 11
----------------------------------------
Results: fully connected neural network


Slide 12
----------------------------------------
Results: CatBoost


Slide 13
----------------------------------------
Results: quality on delayed sample
CatBoost is the best model by average quality on the set of models set aside for testing


Slide 14
----------------------------------------
Results: uncerainty of quality measure
The uncerainty of the quality measure is significantly low for all models


Slide 15
----------------------------------------
Results: uncerainty of the target variable
Trivial model - the model with the lowest uncerainty of the target variable


Slide 16
----------------------------------------
Results: comparison with the trivial model
CatBoost is significantly better than the trivial model


Slide 17
----------------------------------------
Limitations of Current Approaches
Incomplete and sparse data
Historical meteorological data (especially before the mid-20th cenntury) have spatial and temporal gaps → this reduces the stability of models in individual regions.
Lack of temporal structure
Models are trained on individual observations without taking into account temporal autocorrelation → it is imposssible to take into account the dynamics of humidity changes over time.


Slide 18
----------------------------------------
The prospects
Introduction of new modelsUsing more expressive architectures (deep neural networks, transformers) to capture complex nonlinear dependencies.
Expansion of the feature spaceAdding new variables: characteristics of waves, precipiitation, altitude above sea level, weather conditions, cooordinates of the observer, etc.
Intermediat modelsBuildiing auxiilary models for predicting intermediat meteorological parameters and including them as new features.
The use of temporal data is the analysis of temporal sequences of observations (for example, within the framework of ship voyages) using recurrent and attention models to account for dynamics.


Slide 19
----------------------------------------
Conclusions
Machine learning algorithm have shown high efficiency in restoring humidity
A significant improvement in accuracy has been achieved compaared to the trivial approaach (averaging)
CatBoost is the best model for restoring humidity
The deveeloped approaach can be used to fill gaps in the climate series.
