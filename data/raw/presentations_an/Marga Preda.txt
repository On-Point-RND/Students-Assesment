Introduction
The Entorhinal cortex are the key to understanding
memory, navigation, and cognitive impairments, as
well as creating new neural technolologies.

Introduction
• Place cells - are one of the
types of neurons in the
hippocampaal formation that
activate when an animal is in a
certain place.
• According to modern concepts,
place neurons, head direction
neurons, grid neurons,
boundary neurons, and velocity
neurons collectively form the
basis of the brain's navigation
system.

Theory
• We know that the place fields in CA1
modeled using Gaussian functions
!
• At the moment, the size of the place fields in the Entorhinal cortex is unknown.
• We want to know the paramtetrs
