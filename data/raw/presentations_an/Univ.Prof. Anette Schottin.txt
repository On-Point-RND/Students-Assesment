PROBLEM STATEMENT
ML based image compression proved to be
more efficient than industry standard JPG.
Focus of Analysis: examines how adversarial
attacks impact the compression-decompression
process of neural image compression (NIC).

Project Goals
1. Understand how AI compression models work;
2. Test AI compression models on a dataset like Kodak to compress and reconstruct images.
3. Compaare performance with traditional compression methods like JPEG. Evaluate results using
PSNR, SSIM, bit rate BPP metrics;
4. Apply Adversarial Attacks: Generate adversarial examples (e.g., FGSM, PGD) for all kodak
images (24 images);
5. Analyze Robustness: Evaluate attack effectiveness at 3+ compression levels, measuring the
difference between the output of AI compression model before and after the attack.
