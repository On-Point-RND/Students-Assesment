Smart Meal Pla Planning with
[compaany] and RAG:
A Nutrition-Aware AI System
[name]
Why Meal Pla Planning? Why AI?
• Food cnoice affects health, lifestyle, and budget.
• Users want personalized, healthy, affordable meals.
• Supermarkets offer vast product data, but it’s hard to use manually.
• Can we automate meal pla planning using real-time product availability?
Architecture Overview
• Product Data Parsing – Extract products from a retailer’s website.
• Text Processing and Embedding – Clean and index product names.
• RAG System – Retrieve relevannt products and generate meal plans.
• LLM Integration – [compaany] generates natural language menus.
• User Query – Ask for personalized menus (e.g., vegetarian, keto, 3-
meal/day).
Step 1: Product Extraction
• CSV file of ~380 grocery items parsed from retailer.
• Columns: name, category, price.
• Cleaned and converted to raw text.
Step 2: Embedding Product Texts
• RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: splits data into 713 chunks.
• Model: paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2.
• Embeddings stored in FAISS index for fast retrieval.
Step 3: Contextual Product Retrieval
• Use FAISS retriever (k=100) to find top relevannt products.
• Integrate with LangChain retriever interface.
• Works seamlesslly with any user query.
Step 4: Prompted Menu Generation
• Used [compaany] LLM via LangChain integration.
• Custom prompt: Only use products from context.
• If context insufficient → reply honestlly.
Sample Output: Vegetarian Menu
• Query: “Vegetarian 3-day menu. Fish and animal fat allowed.”
• Generated Ouput:
(highlight key meals: frittata, soup, quinoa salad, etc.)
Final Output: JSON Export
• System outputs a JSON with:
• original query
• used product context
• generated answer
• Easy integration into frontend or
chatbot interface.
Why It Matters?
• Personalized nutrition advisors.
• Grocery store chatbots or smart apps.
• Integration into dietary and fitness platforms.
• Scalable for multilingual use.
Future Improvements
• Add nutritional data and price optimization.
• Multilingual queries and outputs.
• Recipe generation using structured formats.
• UI for non-technical users.
