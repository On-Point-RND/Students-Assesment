Automatic Text Simplification for
Physics Education:
Neural vs Rule-Based Approaches
[name]
Student, [location]
Introduction
What is the topic?
Optimizing automated text compression for STEM education by balancing:
• Terminological precision (e.g. [crystal lattice])
• Pedagogical clarity (grade-appropriate readability)
Why is it important?
68 % of educators report students struggle with textbook complexity ([organization], 2022).
Hybrid approaches could personalize learning materials.
Goaal of the review
Compaare neural (FRED-T5) and rule-based (spaCy) methods for physics concept preservation.
Literature Review
Voronov M. V., Pimenov V. I. Formalization of Regulatory Texts
This work formalizes regulatory texts into semantic graphs by leveraging their structured logic and domain terms, achieving 92 % content
preservation. The algo­rithm models causal relationships between key concepts, enabling machine interpretation for compliance tasks. Unlike
general NLP, it exploits regulatory documents' inherent action-sequence clarity.
Suter J., Ebling S., Volk M. Rule-based Automatic Text Simplification for German
This paper presents a rule-based German text simplification system that achieves human-compa­rable readability for acces­sibility contexts. The
method enables scalable processing while maintaining output quality.

Data & Preprocessing
Sources
100 physics paragraphs ([name]’s textbooks for 8th schoo­l year + FIPI exams)
Preprocessing
• Manually annotated [terms] (e.g. [crystal lattice])
• Train/Test split (80/20) with teacher-verified simplifications
Key Adaptation
Added prompt “Simplify keeping [terms]”: to all training examples
Hybrid Approach for Concept-Aware

How it works
FRED-T5 rewrites like a tutor simplifying concepts, while spaCy works as a highlighter preserving exact terms
Quantifying the Tradeoff:
Precision vs Readability
FRED-T5 achieved
82 % term preservation (TPR)
4.1/5 teacher-rated readability
12 % factual errors in causal relationships
spaCy delivered
96 % term preservation (TPR)
2.8/5 readability
Zero factual errors

Research gap
Approach Critical Gaps
Fails on nested terms (e.g. «[удельная теплота парообрazоvаniя]»)
Neural (T5)
Hallucinates relationships («напряжение → темпeратура»)
Cannot generalize to unseen term patterns
Rule-Based
Brittle to syntactic variations
Next Steps
• Integrate equation parsers (SymPy/LaTeX-aware preprocessing)
• Develop educational benchmarks with term preservation metrics
• Teacher-in-the-loop interfaces for rule refi­nement
Application
• For teachers: > 35 % of automated simplifications require manual fixes ([organization], 2023)
• For students: Incorrect term substi­tution correlates with > 20 % lower test scores ([organization], 2022)
