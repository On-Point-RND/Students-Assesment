Data presentation
Original AA Position Mutant AA Score
A 623 L 0.0
A 623 C 1.2
P 640 T -0.2
S 649 T -0.7
S(A623C) = 1.2
What is the effect of multiple substitutions?
S(P640T) = -0.2
S(A623C + P640T) = ?

Epistasis
- Dependence of the phenotype caused by a mutation on other mutations in the
gene
- Definition in terms of DMS:
The sum of the effects of mutations is not equal to the effect of multiple mutations of
a protein!
Epistatic interactions are few => Suggestion that current prediction methods do
not have sufficient generalization power to detect these effects.

Goals
- Collect and pre-process DMS data
- Reproduce the results of modern approaches in mutation effect prediction
task
- Set up an experiment to evaluate the quality of model prediction as a function
of the number of mutations

ProteinGym - Data collection and models benchmarking -
A collection of deep mutation sscanning data and benchmark methods for
predicting variant effects in proteins.
More than 200 DMS datasets, of which 10 representative ones were selected
(>1000 single and double substitutions at >100 positions)

Results
- Succeeded in reproducing the benchmark results with high accuracy
- Evolutionary information helps to improve model predictions quality
(VenusREM).
- Most likely, prediction quality does not depend on the number of mutations in
the query for consideered algorithm. But I am looking further to investigate if
the epistasis interactions does.
