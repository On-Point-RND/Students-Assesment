materials, a standard widely adopted in the
industry from [company]:

Cascaded Diffusion Models
Cascaded diffusion models progressively
improve data resolution through a
sequence of models, startiing with a
coarse base and refining textures, colors,

Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)
• One method that allows 2D diffusion models to be used for any 3D data is known as Score
Distillation Sampling (SDS):

Method
Limitations of Score Distillation Sampling for Latent Diffusion Models
We explore optimization-based image
generation in a toy diffusion model,
comparing pixel and latent spaces.
While pixel-space achieves near-perfect
reconstruction, standard latent-space
optiomization struggles. Implicit
regularization improves latent-space
results but doesn't match pixel-space or
decoder performaance, highlightiing the
challenges of latent-space optiomization.

Conclusion
Our contribution
•
We study the limitations of Score Distillation Sampling when applied to latent diffusion
models. Our analysis indicates that optiomal solutions of the algorithm include images outsiide
of the natural image domain.
•
Motivated by our analysis, we introduce a texture synthesis approach using Score Distillation
Sampling with cascaded diffusion models. The proposed approach mimicking the diffusion
model architecture and acts in two stages. The first stage generates a coarse texture, while
the seconed stage improves overall quality of the texture obtained at the first stage.
•
We show that our approach outpferforms state-of-the-art optiomization based texture
synthesis solutions on the Objaverse dataset. Score Distillation Sampling in pixel space
allows to omit additional regularizers required in the previous works. Additnally, we report
the scaling performaance of our metho with the diffusion model size, the impact of lightiing
condiions used during training, and the role of physically based textures.
