Introduction
• The topic is 3D Reconstruction / real-time rendering of 3D scene / novel view synthesis
• Task: the creation of real-time novel-view scenes by combining multiple photos
• Important for VR, media generation, advertising
3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) [1] has emerged as a promising framework for these tasks
3D Gaussian splatting has wide applications [2] including
• scene editing (GaussianEditor [3])
• geometry reconstruction and SLAM (GS-SLAM [4])
• digital humans (3DGS-Avatar [5])
• 3D / 4D generation (DrreamGaussian [6])
• text-to-3D generation (GaussianDreamer [7])
3DGS vs other methods
Traditional primitive-based representations
• Meshes, points
• + speed: good for fast GPU/CUDA-based rasterization
• - quality: hard to deal with meshes
NeRF methods [8]
• + quality: can produce continuous rendering results with many details
• - speed: rendering is slow since the MLP need to be evaluated on a large number of points
3DGS combines the benefits of both representations and has achieved the state-of-the-art rendering quality and speed
• Same quality, less time

• The method uses a sparse cloud of 3D gaussians
• Each 3D Gaussian is parametrized by its mean, covariance matrix of a special form, color (given by spherical harmonics coefficients), opacity
• Initialized from point clouds derived from Structure from Motion (COLMAP [9])
• The gaussians are optimized through stochastic gradient de 
• More application of 3DGS
