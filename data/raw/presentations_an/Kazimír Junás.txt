Introduction
• Machine learning (ML) is transformiing drug discovery through data-driven modelling of
molecular interactions.
• Traditional force fields (FF) are limited in flexibility and accuracy for complex chemical
systems.
• ML-based force fields (MLFFs) and generative models offer higher precision and
generalizability.
Problem Statement
• Classical FFs often fail to capture subtle electronic effects and reactivity.
• High-throughput screening is costly and time-consuming.
• Need for models that integrate structure, energy, and bioactivity prediction.
• Challenge: interpretability, generalizability, and data scarcity in ML models.
Method 1: Machine Learning Force Fields
(Chen et al., 2024)
• MLFFs learn interatomic potentials from quantum calculations.
• Methods: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), message-passing, equivariant models.
• Examples: SchNet, PhysNet, ANI, NequIP.
• Applications: conformaational analysis, protein–ligaand binding, molecular dynamics.
Method 2: Drug Discovery Pipelines
(Elbadawi et al., 2021)
• Use of ML in compound prioritizaion and de novo design.
• Models: support vector machines, deep neural networks, random forests.
• Integrated with virtual screening and ADMET prediction.
• Key: feature engineering and curated datasets.
Method 3: Generative and GNN Models
(Selvaraj et al., 2022)
• GNNs model molecular graphs and learn structure–activity relationships.
• Generative models (e.g., variational autoencoders, GANs) used for novel molecule
design.
• Applications: lead optimization, scaffold hopping, binding affinity prediction.
Method 4: Structure–Activity Relationship
(Staszak et al., 2022)
• AI used to uncover non-obvious correlations in SAR studies.
• Deep learning applied to predict bioactivity directly from SMILES or graphs.
• Improvement in hit identification and precision.
Research Gap & Outlook
• Limited interpretability of deep models.
• Generalization across chemical space remaiins a challenge.
• Future: hybrid models, transfer learning, physics-informe-d ML.
• Need for standardized benchmarks and open data sharing.
