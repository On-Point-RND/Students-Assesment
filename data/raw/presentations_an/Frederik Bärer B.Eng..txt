**Review of Vision-Language Models: BEiT, CoCa, and FLAVA**  

**Abstract**  
This review examines three state-of-the-art vision-language models: BEiT, CoCa, and FLAVA. These models demonstrate significant advancements in tasks like image-text retrieval, visual question answering, and semantic segmentation. The analysis covers their pretraining strategies, computational efficiency, and performance benchmarks, while highlighting unresolved challenges such as data hunger, limited interpretability, and evaluation scope.

**1. Introduction**  
The field of vision-language modeling has seen rapid progress with frameworks like BEiT, CoCa, and FLAVA. These models leverage large-scale pretraining data and innovative architectures to achieve state-of-the-art results across diverse tasks. However, their reliance on extensive computational resources and data raises questions about scalability and practical deployment.

**2. Methodology**  
**2.1 Pretraining Strategies**  
- **BEiT**: Utilizes masked modeling (text + images) with a unified architecture.  
- **CoCa**: Combines contrastive loss and captioning loss for image-text alignment.  
- **FLAVA**: Integrates contrastive learning, masked modeling, and multimodal inference.  

**2.2 Datasets**  
- **BEiT**: Public datasets (15M images + 21M text pairs).  
- **CoCa**: [Location] public dataset (JFT-3B) and noisy web data (ALIGN).  
- **FLAVA**: [Location] public image-text pairs (70M).

**3. Results**  
**3.1 State-of-the-Art Performance**  
- **BEiT**: Achieves SOTA on 7+ benchmarks (e.g., COCO retrieval, VQA, ImageNet: 89.6% Top-1).  
- **CoCa**: Sets new zero-shot ImageNet (86.3%) and retrieval (Flickr30K R@1: 92.5%) records.  
- **FLAVA**: Outperforms CLIP on 35 tasks (e.g., ImageNet linear eval: 79.44%, VQA: 72.49%).  

**3.2 Multitask Versatility**  
- All models handle vision-only (classification), text-only (GLUE), and multimodal tasks.  
- **BEiT**: Excels in dense tasks (ADE20K: 62.8 mIoU).  

**3.3 Efficient Pretraining**  
- **BEiT**: Uses masked modeling, reducing batch size needs.  
- **FLAVA**: Trained on public data (70M pairs) yet matches models with private data.

**4. Challenges**  
**4.1 Compute and Data Hunger**  
- **BEiT**: Requires 1.9B parameters and 1M pretraining steps.  
- **CoCa**: Needs 65k batch size for contrastive learning.  
- **FLAVA**: 70M pairs vs. private models (e.g., CLIP/ALIGN).  

**4.2 Limited Interpretability**  
- **BEiT**: No analysis of masked modeling alignment.  
- **CoCa/FLAVA**: Lack probing studies on unimodal/multimodal representations.  

**4.3 Narrow Evaluation Scope**  
- All models tested on English-only tasks.  
- Minimal testing in low-resource domains (e.g., medical imaging).

**5. Future Work**  
- Scaling to more modalities (e.g., audio).  
- Improving fine-grained multimodal tasks.  
- Bridging performance gaps with private-data models.
