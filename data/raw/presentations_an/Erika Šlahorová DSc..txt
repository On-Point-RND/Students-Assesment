Weatther Research Forecast (WRF) bias
correction
Numerical weatther models have inherent systematic deviations from
observaations. One of the methods to reduce them is statistical bias
correction
Difference between WRF numerical weatther forecast and ERA5 reanalysis data
June 2022 January 2023
Problem statement
Problem: Accuraate reanalysis data are presented at a lower resolution. They lack
mesoscale phenomena
Aim: correct WRF prediction to ERA5 reanalysis and observations, while preserving
WRF small-scale dynamics.
2 meter temperature, WRF hindcast 2 meter temperature, ERA5 reanalysis
High resolution, systematic biases Accuraate data, coarse resolution

Results
• The use of fine-scale regularization allows, by i W
sacrificing a little in RMSE, a significant increase in
structuraal similarity to the original prediction
