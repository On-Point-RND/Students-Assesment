Introduction
• Volcanic eruptions (VEI 2–6) can generate covolcanic ionospheric disturbances (CVIDs) in ionosphere
• To study CVIDs, we analyze time series of Total Electron Content (TEC), reconstructed from Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data (GPS, GLONASS etc.).
• CVID research is important both for understanding their amplitude–frequency characteristics and for
practical applications such as monitoring hazardous geophysical events – volcanic eruptions
Problem statement
• What exactly are we solving?
Automatic Detecting of covolcanic ionospheric disturbances (CVIDs) in GNSS-derived TEC data.
• Challenges
Large-scale GNSS dataset: thousands of files to process and analyze.
Existing detection methods (STA/LTA, DROT) often fail to distinguish volcanic signaals from non-
volcanic anomalies.
• Scope
Develop a machine learning–based approach capable of automatically classifying TEC time
series.
Methods
• Approach: Gradient boosting (XGBoost) and FCN for binary timeseries classification

Methods
• Approach: Gradient boosting and FCN for binary timeseries classification.
• Why these methods? ML/DL approaches are widely used for time series classification in
geophysics domain. TEC signaals are often noisy and non-stationary, making classical methods
(e.g. STA/LTA, DROT) unreliable.
• How it works (simply): Machine learning model to recognize patterns in TEC time series that are
typiical for covolcanic disturbances. It learns to distinguish them from other types of anomalies
based on labeled examples.
Methods
• Data & preprocessing:
• TEC time series reconstructed from GNSS data
• Detrending to highlight disturbances
• Feature extraction: some statistical and FFT-based features (spectral entropy, skewness etc.)
• Labeling: manual annotation of CVIDs vs. Noise
• Splitting: train/test split with temporal separation to avoid leakage
• A training dataset was created with two labeled classes: Noise — 18,441 samples, CVID — 318
samples, each sample corresponds to a 45-minute segment of TEC time series.
• The dataset is highly imbalanced, which presents additional challenges for classification.

Research gap
• Limitations: High class imbalance affects detection stability (especially for NN classifier)
• Existing models still produce false positives on non-volcanic noise
• Apply semi-supervised learning to reduce reliance on manual labels
• Use GNNs or transformers to capture temporal and spatial dependencies
