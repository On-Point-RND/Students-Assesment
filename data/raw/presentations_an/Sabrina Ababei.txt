Multimodal Approaches for Automated Mapping in Sports Orienteering

Introduction

Using multimodal data (satellite imagery, LiDAR, text) to generate maps.
Why is it important?
Manual map creation is labor-intensive and subjective.
Automation improves accuracy and adaptability.
Review goal:
Analyze state-of-the-art methods (CVPR, NeurIPS, ICML) for orienteering applications.



Problem statement

What are we solving?
Low detail in trails and terrain.
Dynamic environmental changes (seasons, obstacles).
Route personalization.
Challenges:
Modality gap (satellite ↔ ground-level data).
Lack of annotated datasets.



Cross-modal Map Learning for Vision and Language Navigation
Approach:
Transformer with cross-modal attention (ResNet + BERT).
Training on egocentric maps.
Data: Matterport3D, VLN-CE.
(CVPR 2022)
GitHub: https://github.com/ggeorgak11/CM2 



Coming Down to Earth: Satellite-to-Street View Synthesis (NeurIPS 2021)
Approach:
GAN + polar transformations for street-view synthesis.
Joint training of synthesis and geolocalization.
Results: PSNR ↑ 15% on CVUSA/CVACT.
Code: https://github.com/aysiim/comingdowntoearth 



Terrain Diffusion Network (ICML 2023)
Approach:
Diffusion model + geological sketches.
Multi-scale noise suppression.
Data: NASA topography.
Code: https://github.com/DmitryRyumin/AAAI-2024-Papers/blob/main/sections/2024/main/601_800.md 



Results

Key findiings:
Cross-modal Learning: Navigation accuracy ↑ 20% (VLN-CE).
Satellite-to-Street: Photorealistic synthesis (SSIIM > 0.8).
TDN: Superior terrain quality vs. GAN (FID ↓ 30%).
Metrics:
Accuracy (R@k), PSNR, FID.



Research gap

Limitations:
Limited real-time processing.
Weak adaptation to extreme conditions.
Future opportunities:
Federated learning for privacy.
Integration with AR navigation.
