Introduction
• FREED is a fragment based model for de-novo molecule generation that uses deep reinforcement
learning and graph convolutional networks to archive this goal
• De novo drug design plays crucial role in drug discovery process, making it more cheap and fast
comparing to traditional drug discovery methods. FREED exploits the idea of making more drug – like
molecules by using fragment databases which tend to cover up large space of existing drugs
• There is a thesis by scientiists from [compaany] called FREED++, which fixed bugs connected to the original
FREED implementaion, making the algorithm significantly faster and better-performiing. Therefore, I will
refe**r** to it in my overview
• However, FREED++ still has some issues that need to be addressed. Thus, I will propose my own
approa**c**h to improving how this model can be trained on a dataset of synthesizable molecules
Problem statement
• FREED solves the problem of generating molecules with needed chemi**c**al properties, such as
DockingScore, to ensure high binding affinity with the target protei**n**
• The main challenge of modern methods in drug design is that molecules are being constructed atom by
atom, ignoring stereohemi**c**al properties of molecules, making them less drug-like, toxic, and often
impos**s**ible to synthe**s**ize
• I will cover the ar**c**hitecture of the algo**r**ithm, issues that were fixed by the FREED++ implemen**t**ation, and
will also reproduce the results from the article. Additional**l**y, I will highl**i**ght poten**t**ial problems.
• I will propose my own research on this theme and share the results with you
Methods
• GCN and SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) were used in FREED/FREED++
• This is fragment-based generation, so the molecu**l**e is assembled from fragment libraries. Every
fragment is stored as a graph and is encoded by GCN for further processing. SAC is a state-of-
the-art deep RL algo**r**ithm that is trained to opti**m**ize the entropy of the final molecu**l**ar distribution
and also the Docking Score (how well a molecu**l**e binds with a given target)
• At first, a fragment is encoded by GCN. Afte**r**wards, this encoded fragment is given as input to an
MLP to find the opti**m**al point where the next fragment will be attached. After that, the next
fragment is chosen by the MLP. Then the next point is found again. This result (concatenation of
vectors) is given to the Critic ar**c**hitecture, which approxi**m**ates Q-values

Research gap
• Re**s**e**r**chers from the article are focusing on the Docking Score metric (how well a molecu**l**e binds to
the target protei**n**) and provide benchma**r**ks for it. However, other properties such as cLogP also matter.
I reproduced the results and found out that cLogP metrics are way too high to use drugs generated by
this approa**c**h.
• I propose using another library and constraints to train the algo**r**ithm to fix this problem.
Fixing gap (step 1)
• My approa**c**h was to construct dataset using the SciFinder library, comprising synthe**s**izable carboxylic
acids with heterocyclic fragm**e**nts (N, S) and carboxyl groups (-C(=O)O-). Molecules are generated by
forming peptide bonds between the α-amino group (-NH2) of one acid and the α-carboxyl group (-
COOH) of another, ensuring synthetic feasibility. Fragment selection was based on the mean
DockingScore for target protei**n**s, yi**e**lding a chemi**c**al space of size 200. This approa**c**h guarantees
synthe**s**izability of generated compounds. Lets call this dataset nexg**e**n.

Fixing gap (step 2)
• Next, I simplified the FREED++ algo**r**ithm to o**n**ly select fragm**e**nts, as attac**h**ment points are now fixed
due to the type of bondi**n**g.
