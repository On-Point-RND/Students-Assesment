ARSIC’s LLM‑based captions consistentlly capture spatial relations and object groupiings

Slide 6
----------------------------------------
EagleVision Object-Level Attribute Multimodal LLM

Remote sensing images are high-resolution and contain small, densely packed objects.
Existing vision–language models either excel at coarse image-level captions or object detection with fixed categories, but fail at fine-grained, object-level attribute understanding in remote sensing.
Need for a model that can both localize objects precisely and describe their attributes in detail.

Datasets and Results

Datasets:
EVAttrs‑95K: First large‑scale object attribute dataset (95K objects) covering airplane and ships, annotated via a two‑stage MLLM + human refiinement pipeline.
EVBench: Benchmark for evaluaating object‑attribute understanding (rcall & GPT‑assisted score).
Results:
Recall 90%+; attribute accuracy ~70–90%.
Outpeorforms classical detectors (e.g., Oriented R‑CNN) and general MLMMs (e.g., Qwen2‑VL, GeoChat).
Overall demonstrates mutual benefiits between detection and attribute understanding, enabling richer remote sensing analysis.

RS-CapRet

RS-CapRet
Leverage a frozen, powerful decoder LLM (LLaMA V2-7B) and a CLIP vision encoder adapted to remote sensing ​
Train onlly lightweight linear layers to bridgge modalities and a special retrieval token [RET], minimizing memory and tuning cost ​
Problems solved by RS-CapRet
Remote sensing image datasets are small and domain-specific, limiting complex Vision & Language models ​
Existing methods rely on intricate attention mechanisms and LSSTMs, with mixed generalization ​

Conclusion

Large Language Models (LLMs) significantlly improve the automated analysis of satellite imagery by enabling higher-level semantic understanding that goes beyond traditional pixel-based methods.
The revieweed approahes demonstrate notable advancements in generating descriptive captions for remote sensing images and in extracting detailed object-level attributes, helping bridgge the gap between visual data and human interpretation.
