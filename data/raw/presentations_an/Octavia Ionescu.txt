RAG systems
Problem statement
overview
- Paper 1: Enhancing factual accuracy in Medical Vision Language Models (Med-
LVLMs) by addressing issues arising from over-reliance on retrieved contexts in
RAG systems.
- Paper 2: Determining optimal strategies for integrating multimodal inputs (text
and images) into RAG systems for industrial applications.
- Paper 3: Identifying best practices in RAG workflows to balance performance
and efficiency, particularly in complex, multimodal settings.
- Paper 4: Comparing the effectiveness of base versus instruction-tuned LLLMs
within RAG frameworks, challenging assumptions about model alignment and
performance
Key Challenges and Scope
Challenges:
Balancing retrieval quantity and relevance
•
Handling multimodal input
•
Complexity of pipeline choices
•
Model alignment and instruction tuning
•
Scope:
Medical, industrial, general QA, and foundational evaluation
Methods - Approaches
Paper 1: RULE strategy + preference fine-tuning
Paper 2: Compare image-to-text vs. multimodal embeddings
Paper 3: Exhaustive config testing + retrieval-as-generation
Paper 4: Empirical evaluation of base vs tuned models
Intuition:
Paper 1: RULE == Calibrate context size
•
Paper 2: Best modality for QA
•
Paper 3: Best RAG configs
•
Paper 4: Real-world model comparison
•
Data & Preprocessing
Paper 1: Medical VQA, preference dataset creation
Paper 2: Industrial docs, image-to-text summaries
Paper 3: Standard datasets, consistent preprocessing
Paper 4: RAG benchmarks, fairness across models
Results
Paper 1: RULE significantly improved factual accuracy in medical RAG tasks—up to 47.4% across
datasets—by optimizing context quantity and model fine-tuning.
Paper 2: Textual summaries of images outperformed multimodal embeddings in industrial RAG tasks,
highlighting the strength of text-based visual grounding.
Paper 3: Demonstrated that RAG performance depends heavily on fine-grained design choices, and that
“retrieval as generation” can be surprisingly effective.
Paper 4: Showed that base LLLMs, when supported by high-quality retrieval, can outperform instruction-
tuned models—challenging common assumptions.
Common metrics across papers:
- Accuracy and factual correctness (e.g., via human evaluation or automatic fact-checking)
- BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR for generation tasks
- Retrieval precision/recall and Top-k accuracy
- Trustworthiness and hallucination rate (Paper 4)
These metrics matter because:
- They capture how factually correct and useful the generated content is.
- They help assess how well the model grounds its generation in retrieved knowledge (a key RAG goal).
Research gap
Paper Limitations
Paper - Tailored to the medical domain; generalizability is untested.
1 - Relies on curated preference datasets, limiting scalability.
- Assumes access to high-quality image-to-text models; lacks analysis under noisy
Paper
image conditions.
2
- Focuses only on industrial QA, not broader multimodal RAG use cases.
Paper - No automated tools for RAG pipeline optimization; manual tuning still needed.
3 - High computational cost for evaluating all design choices.
- Limited to general-domain QA; doesn’t address performance in domain-specific
Paper
settings.
4
- Ignores multi-turn interactions common in real-world RAG scenarios.
Research gap
Unresolved Challenges
Adapting retrieval to query complexity and user intent
•
Reducing hallucinations without limiting model creativity
•
Scaling RAG to noisy, real-world multimodal data
•
Lack of benchmarks for multimodal/domain-specific tasks
•
Why It Matters
Factual errors erode trust in critical domains
•
Robust retrieval boosts reliability and generalization
•
Multimodal support unlocks new, high-impact applications
•
Future opportunities
- Unified frameworks for automated RAG pipeline tuning and
evaluation.
- Domain-adaptive training for RAG systems to perform well across
specialized fields.
- Multimodal benchmarking to test how visual, auditory, and textual
inputs influence generation quality.
- Continual RAG learning, where the model updates its retrieval
strategy over time based on feedback.
- Human-in-the-loop systems that refine retrieval/generation using
expert feedback, especially in sensitive domains.
