Image of
a growth medium with
a microorganism in it
Motivation: fast and precise microorganism identification is crucial for assigning the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment for the patient
Main stages of pathogen identification process:
Biomaterial collection
Cultivation inside growth medium (24-36 hours)
Sample preparation (1 hour and more depending on the method)
Identification: 
Time-of-flight mass-spectrometery (+1 hour, bigger laboratories)
Biochemical identification (+24 hours)

RESEARCH objective AND TASKS for achieving it
Objective: to develop a model that classifies microorganisms into 25 key clinically relevant species based on fluorescence spectroscopy and optical imaging.
Tasks:
To conduct an exploratory analysis of the experimental data obtained, to select a metric for assessing the quality of classification
To develop models and input preprocessing methods for classification from fluorescence spectroscopy, optical imaging, and combined optical data from both modalities, and compare the models with each other
Analyze the importance of different spectral components on classification accuracy and how number of excitation wavelengths for fluorescence spectroscopy data affects the score
Optimize the architectures of the developed models to maximize classification accuracy

ACCUMULATED OPTICAL RESPONSE DATASET
Clinically important (CI) species are the key categories of microorganisms in identification, identified by the microbiologists of the [location] City Clinical Hospital No67
Distribution of the number of samples by clinically important (CI) species in the collected optical dataset for classification
The classification task is further complicated by:
High number of predicted classes
A sharp imbalance in the number of representatives among different classes in the collected dataset
