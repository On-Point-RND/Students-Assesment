## Analysis of the Provided Papers (ICRA 2024 & 2025)

Here's a breakdown of the three papers, highlighting their topics, importance, methods, and key findings.

### Paper 1: Self-Corrective Task Planning by Inverse Prompting with Large Language Models (ICRA 2024)

**Topic:** Self-corrective task planning for robots using inverse prompting with large language models (LLMs).

**Importance:** This paper addresses a critical challenge in robotics: the reliability of task planning generated by LLMs. LLMs often produce plausible but infeasible plans. This work proposes a method to enhance plan accuracy by enabling LLMs to detect and correct errors autonomously. This is highly relevant to the focus on LLMs and safe AI in SMILES-2025 and aligns with projects like pick-and-place and Eurobot.

**Methods:** The paper introduces **InversePrompt**, a self-corrective strategy utilizing LLMs with multi-step reasoning:
* **State Verification:** The LLM checks if the current state matches the goal state.
* **Inverse Action Application:** If a discrepancy is found, the LLM attempts to apply the inverse of the last executed action.
* **Goal State Confirmation:** After the inverse action, the LLM re-verifies the state.

The LLM translates tasks into a structured format (potentially PDDL-like), generates a plan, and then iteratively applies inverse actions based on state comparisons. Few-shot in-context learning is used with prompt examples.

**Data & Preprocessing:** The method is evaluated on benchmark datasets like Ballmoving, BlocksWorld, and Cooking. Task goals are converted to a structured format, and states are normalized for LLM input.

**Results:** InversePrompt demonstrates significant improvements in plan accuracy:
* Achieves **16.3% higher average success rate** compared to standard LLM methods.
* **Outperforms external validators by 8%** and standard self-correction by 17%.
* Requires **fewer refinement attempts** for correction.

**Research Gap:** The paper acknowledges limitations in evaluating the method on complex, non-PDDL domains or highly dynamic environments. It also notes that the dependence on predefined action inverses might limit generalizability.

**Future Opportunities:** The authors suggest integrating multimodal inputs (e.g., vision) for richer state verification and exploring generative models for inverse action prediction.

**Bibliography:** The bibliography includes recent work on LLMs for planning, reasoning, grounding language in robotic affordances, and using LLMs for complex tasks like cooking.

**Overall Significance:**

The papers collectively highlight a significant trend in robotics research: leveraging the power of large language models for task planning. However, they also acknowledge the need for addressing the inherent limitations of LLMs in generating reliable and executable plans. The focus on self-correction through inverse prompting represents a promising direction for improving the robustness and practicality of LLM-based robotic systems. This research is highly relevant to the ongoing advancements in AI and robotics and has the potential to enable more autonomous and adaptable robots in real-world applications.
