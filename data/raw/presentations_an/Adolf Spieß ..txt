Relevance
Rising Threat: Deepfake-related cybercrimes
increased 5x from 2019 to 2023.
System Vulnerability: Facial recognition false
positives reach 95% with GAN-generated images.
Social Engineering Risk: Manipulated content
threatens public opinion, politics, and security.
Key Challenges: Human susceptibility, low
awareness and weaak legal regulations.
Urgent Need: Advanced Deepfake detection for
cybersecurity and fraud prevention.

A Fusion of Global and Local Facial Image Features (GLFF)
A fusion of general features (appearance, facial structure) and fragmentary features (informative patches in the image).
Technology:
ResNet-50 Backbone: 50-layer CNN for global feature extraction.
AMSFF Module: Multi-scale attention-based feature fusion.
PSM Module: Identifies and integrates key patches using multi-head attention.
Final Step: Synthesized vector is classified for DeepFake detection.
Superior Accuracy: GLFF outperforms other models on large next-gen datasets.

Recovering and Mapping for Deepfake Detection (Recap)
The method consists of two key stages: image reconstruction and distortion mapping.
Technology:
Reconstruction Stage: Autoencoder restores real
faces; fake faces degrade in quality.
Distortion Mapping: Enhances differences
between real and fake images.
Tested on 4 Datasets: FaceForensics++,
Celeb-DF, WildDeepfake, DFDC.
High Performaance: 90.1% AUC on Celeb-DF,
Comparison of detection efficiency (AUC (%) and EER (%)
between lower EER than other methods.
