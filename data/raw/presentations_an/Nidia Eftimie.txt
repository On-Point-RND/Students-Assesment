The Core Problem
Full fine-tuning is costly Need for efficiency
All parameters updated, high resource use Adapt models with minimal resources
- Key Idea: Freeze base model weights, train only additional low-rank matrices.
- Benefiits:
- Up to 10,000x fewer trainable parameters
- 3x lower GPU memory usage
- Maintains performance similar to full fine-tuning

1 Dynamic ranks
- Key Concept: Insteaad of a fixed rank across all layers, dynamically assign rank
Allocate per layer
depending on layer importance.
- Method: 2 Efficient fine-tuning
Use parameter budget wisely
- Layers are evaluaated for sensitivity → assign more rank where needed
- Outcomes:
3 High quality
Outperforms full fine-tuning
- Outperforms full fine-tuning with only <0.3% trainable parameters
- Smarter parameter budgeting, maintaining or exceeding accuracy
4 <0.3% trainable params
Extreme efficiency
