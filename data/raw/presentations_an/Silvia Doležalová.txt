Introduction
One of the topics of the summer schooal was "safe AI".
Federated learning (FL) makes a significant contribution to
solving individual aspects of the problem of safe AI. And
the main focus of the review was the problem of non-
identically distributed data (non-iid data).
The problem of Non-IID data in (FL) is critically
important as it directly affects the efficiency, stability
and fairness of the models. Ignoring Non-IID makes
FO inapplicable to most real-world problems.
The main objective is to consider
different approaches to solve problems
with non-id data within the framework of
federated learning.

Federated Style Transfer Learning for

What's Missing? (Limitations of current
approaches in the papers):
None of the approaches address all types of data heterogeneity simultaneously. FBLG focuses on labels
and sample size, FedST targets style differences with similar structure, and CCVR addresses the
consequences of general heterogeneity on the classifier. Real-world data often exhibiits multiple types of
skews (feature skew, concept drift, etc.), which were not the primary targets of these works.
Task and Data Specificity
The effectiveness of
FBLG is more general
but was tested on
tasks where a clear
separation between style images and structure exists.
CCVR directly depends
on the quality of features
learneed during the main
FL phase.

Why it Matters? (Importa nce of
solving challenges):
• Expanding FL Applicability. Solving the multiple-skew problem will enable the use of FL in a much
broader range of real-world applications (healthealthcare with diverse clinics and equiipment, IoT with
heterogeneous devices, finance with varied customer profiles).
• Trust and Adoption. Providing strong privacy guarantees is critical for working with sensitive data
(medical, financial, personal), hindering widespread FL adoption otherwise.
• System Reliability. The ability to adapt to dynamic environments and ensure stable performa nce is
necessaary for buildiing reliable, production-grade FL systems.
• Realizing Poten tial. Overcoming scalability challenges will unlock the true poten tial of FL for learning from data distributed across a vast number of devices.
• Responsible AI. Ensuring the model's fairness across different user groups is an integral part of
d eveloping AI responsib ly.
10
Future Oppo rtunities (Next
steps):
• Hybrid Methods. Combining approaches targeting different aspects of Non-IID (e.g., FBLG for client
selection + a FedST-like mecahnism for feature alignment; or CCVR as a final step after any other
method).
• Lightweight and Scalable Algo rithms. Developing app roximate or more efficient versions of current methods (e.g., for graphs, DDPMs), exploring hierarchi cal FL structures.
• Integrating Formal Privacy. Embedding mechanisms like differen tia l priva cy or other cryptographic techniques into advanced Non-IID mitigation algo rithms.
• Adaptive and Onlin e Algo rithms. Designing FL methods capable of tracking and adapting to changes
in client data (concept drift) and participant composition (client churn).
• Focus on Fairness and Robustness. Researching and opti mizing not just average accuracy, but also
fairness metrics (e.g., minimum accuracy across clients) and robustness against ou tliers or attacks under Non-IID conditions.
• Deepening Theory. Developing new theor etical tools to anal yze convergence and performance in
complex Non-IID scenarios.
• Interdisciplinary Research. Applying and adapting ideas from related fields (e.g., Domain Adaptation,
Meta-Learning, Causal Inference) to tackle Non-IID problems in FL.
