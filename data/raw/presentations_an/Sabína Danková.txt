Why Do We Need Personalized Heart Models?
Personalized Medicine:
Testing New Drugs and Therapies on
Studying the conditions under which Human Models Instead of Animals:
arrhythmias occur in a specific patient
Not all drugs can be tested on animals
Creating high-quality 3D models to
improve ablation procedures and reduce It is difficult to accurately predict the
recurrence in cardiac surgery effects of medications on the human
heart using animal models
Traditional algorithms without neural
networks either perform poorly or fail to
solve the task at all
Proposed Solution:
The solution will be a part of a personalized 3D model of the human heart.
1. Dataset Acquisition
The dataset was obtained from the [location] Regional Research and Clinical
Institute (MONIKI).
2. Interpolation Task
The dataset allows us to construct a
3D model, but initially it looks like this: Reason – large spacing between slices
Solution – applying interpolation using the
RIFE neural network
Why RIFE?
● The alternative neural network DAIN is now considered outdated; RIFE was introduced
only in 2020
● RIFE was trained on two massive high-quality video datasets
● Like traditional interpolation networks, RIFE builds a depth map and identifies individual
objects. However, it only reconstructs parts of the frames where object motion occurs
Result: According to the developers, RIFE is 4 times faster than its predecessors
3. Validate Interpolation Quality on the Training Dataset
Remove original MRI slices, keep
only those obtained via
interpolation
Run the interpolation algorithm on
them
Compare the results with the
original slices
Average Dice Coefficient: 0.8773
What is DICE?
A similarity measure between two sets, often used to assess the quality of binary
segmentation, for example, in object detection tasks in images (including medical
ones).
∣A∣ — the number of pixels in the predicted mask that correspond to the object (ones).
∣B∣ — the number of pixels in the ground truth mask that correspond to the object
(ones).
∣A∩B∣ — the number of matching pixels (where both the prediction and the ground truth
have a value of 1).
4. Check the interpolation quality on another dataset.
A high-quality training dataset
has already been found* — over
9 Tesla MRI of fixed explanted
hearts.

5. Future work: calibration of the electrophysiologicaal model.
MGA – Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm* is planned The base model Courtemanche
to be used for model calibration.
The values of sodium, calcium, and other channels in
the model will be adjusted — this will help us
understand whether the model is functioning
correctly.

6. Simulations in OpenCarp and Refralon.
OpenCARP is an open-source simulator of cardiac
electrophysiology for virtual experiments.
Refralon is a next-generation antiarrhythmic drug. Its
mechanism of action is planned to be demonstrated on a 3D model of the heart.
Architecture and novelty of the proposed solution:
The journal Nature published an article in
2024* addressing a similar interpolation
problem for brain MRI.
We have obtained the same solution for
atrial MRI independently of theirs.
Currently, we have no competitors in [location]
who have entered the market.
