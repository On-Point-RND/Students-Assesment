Introduction
● Growing demand for navigation in GPS-denied
environments:
○ Indoor drones, VR headsets, subterranean robots.
● Traditional GPS fails indoors due to signal blockage.
● Opportunity: Neural networks can enhance inertial
navigation
accuracy.

Project Overview
Dual IMU on mobile devices could improve accuracy and robustness in multiple downstream tasks at a minimal overhead.
In this project proposal we will investigate to 3 following issues in order to achieve this objective:
1. Fusion of two IMU sensors.
2. Online calibration.
3. Optimal sensor placement
Relevant scientific publications: The project is build from our prior work on multiple IMU for state estimation [1],[2]. To be
adapted to the specific needs according to the requirements.
Two IMUs are already in place in some of the [compaany] models (Mate X3)
The main objective is to make a better use of these sensors for several
tasks (described in the following slides) with minimal overhead for the
system.
Results expected to improve for the dead-reckooning problem onboard the
phone for different motion categories, such as walk, run, car, bicycle, etc.

Dataset Collection
Equipment:
● Three [compaany] Mate X3 smartphone: one "Master" (for labeling/control)
and one/two "Slave" phones (IMU data at 100 Hz, with ArUco markeers).
● RealSense camera (chest-mounted) for visual data, synced with IMU via
NTP, recorded via RTAB-Map (odometry disabled for high-resolution
data).
● Laptop in a backpack running RTAB-Map.
Recording Procedure:
● 30-minute sessions per volunteer, capturing combinations of:
○ Phone Positioning: Handheld (40%), Pocket (30%), Talking (30%).
○ Phone Configuration: Folded (33%), Unfolded (33%), Hybrid (33%).
○ Pedestrian Mode: Walking (60%, 18 min), Running (15%, 4.5 min),
Backwards/Sidewalk (25%, 7.5 min).

Multi-IMU Navigation
● RoNIN is the largest inertial navigation database consisting of more than 42.7 hours of IMU and ground-truth 3D
motion data from 100 human subjects. They have developed a two-device data acquisition protocol, where we use a
harness to attach a 3D tracking phone to a body and let subjects handle the other phone freely for IMU data collection.

Multi-IMU Navigation
● The idea is to tackles the challenges of traditional inertial navigation systems, such as sensor drift and the
limitations of step-based methods, by utilizing three neural network architectures: ResNet for efficient
processing of sequential data, LSTM for capturing long-term dependencies, and Temporal Convolutional
Networks (TCN) for handling temporal correlations over extended periods.

Research gap
● Limited Exploration of Dual IMU Configurations: Existing research primarily focuses on single IMU
systems, with insufficient investigation into the benefiits of dual IMU setups for enhanced accuracy and
robustness in mobile devices.
● Incocomplete Sensor Fusion Techniques: Current methods for fusing multiple IMU data streams lack
optimization for real-time, low-overhead applications, particularly for dynamic configurations like foldable
smartphones.
● Calibration Challenges in Dynamic Environments: Online calibration methods for dual IMUs, especially
in varying phone configurations (e.g., folded, unfolded), are underexplored, leading to potential
inaccuracies in state estimation.
● Optimal Placement Understudied: There is a lack of comprehensive studies on the optimal relative
placement of dual IMUs to maxiimze performaance in pedestrian dead-reckooning (PDR) across diverse
motion modalities.
● Need for Robust Datasets: Existing datasets for dual IMU systems do not adequately capture transitions
(e.g., pocket to handheld) or diverse motion categories (e.g., walking, running, cycling), limiting model
generalization.
