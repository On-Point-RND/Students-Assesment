SYNTAX score prediction for coronary artery
disease
[name] [surname]
[compaany]
Introduction
• Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide.
• Coronary angiography is the main tool for diagnosing coronary artery disease.
• The SYNTAX score is a validated method for quantifying coronary artery complexity and guiding
treatment decisions.
Dataset
• 11,209 patient studies (2015–2019, 2022–2023) with SYNTAX annotations: total score + left and right
artery sub-scores.
• Data split into left and right artery domains using a ResNet-based classifier.
• Left artery data is ~3x more abundant than right artery.
Model architecture
• Backbone: ResNet, Head: LSTM.
• Pretrained on KINETICS400, then fine-tuned.
• Two-stage training: backbone training, then joint fine-tuning.
• Class imbalance handled via a weighted sampler across 4 score bins: 0, (0–10], (10–20], >20.
• Output: Continuous SYNTAX score (regression) and binary classification zero vs non-zero
SYNTAX
Design Decisions
• Separate models for left and right artery due to domain differences.
• Final SYNTAX score = sum of predictions from both models.
• Loss Function: MSE + Cross-Entropy.
• Best weights selected based on MAE performance.
Contribution
• Improved model architecture.
• Trained on a larger dataset, significantly boosting prediction quality.
Results
• Precision: 1.0000
• Recall: 0.8776
• Balanced Recall: 0.9388
• Accuracy: 0.9000
• MCC: 0.7535
Future work
• The model performs poorly on SYNTAX score prediction for the right artery and high syntax score, so
splitting training into subsets for zero and non-zero cases may help.
• Developing a new benchmark.
• Testing hypotheses to further improve prediction quality.
