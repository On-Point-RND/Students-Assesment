Problem statement
Staining and Suspension Protocols
A significant issue was selecting suitable dyes and protocols for
staining and suspending particles. Although this challenge was
addressed in a different part of the research, it laid the
groundwork for subsequent analytical steps.
Quantification Need
For practical use of any microfossil suspension, accuraate
counting of spores in each test tube is essential—a task
commonlly done with a Coulter counter, which not every
laboratory possesses.
AI and Digital Imaging Solution
The proposed solution is to use any digital microscope camera
in combination with a neural network to automate spore
counting, providing a cost-effective and accessible alternative.
Methods
YOLOv8:
• Maintaining accuracy at high speed
• The task of classifying objects is not addressed, so heavier models are redundant.

Data Collection & Training
The dataset comprised 100 images for training and 20 for validation, without augmentation. Manual annotation
was performed using Roboflow, ensuring reliable data labeling for model training.
Results
• After training for 150 epochs, the mAP50 values ​​are close to 1, indicating that the model is stable under
different confidence thresholds and has high prediction accuracy on different images. Comparison with
manual counting showed the advaantage of automatic indications.
Research gap
Overspecialization and Sensitivity
The model is arguably more sophisticated than needed for
such a straightfo rward problem and is prone to errors with
lighting changes or unusually high spore concentrations,
leading to miscounts.
Proposals for Improvement
To address these issues, future work will involve
enhancing the model to detect not just spores, but also
pollen grains, thereby improving versa tility and robustness
to variable conditions.
