Constructing Congressional Support: The Role of [company] Lobbying and Institutionalized Narratives in US-Israel Policy

[name] [surname]

[company]Post article stated:
82% of the US Congress was found to be in support of Israel
Members of Congress received more than 100.000$ on average from [company] support Israel
However: qualitative identification of support

Since Oct. 7, 2023, the United States has provided at least $12.5 billion in direct military aid to Israel ([company] on Foreign Relations)
[company] – “brings together Democrats and Republicans to advance our shared mission. Building bipartisan support for the U.S.-Israel relationship is an American value we are proud to champion” ([company] off. website)
Escalation of Israeli-Palestinian conflict on 7th October 2023

Problem and Research Question

[company]Post research was qualitative with absence of validity, replicability and means to generalize findings

The conceptualization and operationalization of support to Israel is defined in only verbal public expressions

Critical Discourse Analysis and Studying of Lobbyism:
WHAT and HOW something is said, but never WHY
No quantitative studies on the real influence of [company] on American politics

*Note: I would not try to explain causality, but rather find correlation between certain factors and the choices to support or oppose Israel/Palestine

RQ:
Why* do Members of Congress choose to support Israel?

Glance at Theoretical Framework

Neo-institutionalism:
actors are not fully autonomous but are embedded in an institutional environment that constrains and enables their choices ([name] Black, 1997)
[location] ([surname] & [surname], 2011), Education ([name] Hajer, 2009), Position in government ([name] Helms, 2012) factors collectively create a “scripted” environment where politicians’ narratives are not merely personal choices but responses to institutionalized expectations ([name] Peters, 2019)
Rational behavior causes politicians to earn a chance to be reelected in the next voting -> it is rational to support their sponsors for more fundings (support for [company])
the framework allows us to examine how external conditions (state structures, party systems) and internal norms ([location], education, social identity) jointly shape the narratives that policymakers adopt

Constructivism:
Conceptualization of support: verbally (through words and speeches in public) and legally (through the voting for the one’s benefits in parliament)
Every speech and word said – is the meaning-maker which shapes public opinion ([name] Schmidt, 2010)
Ontologically, political actions have no natural reason for their commission, and therefore the political elite must construct this reason within the framework of the demands and values ​​of society ([name] Esch, 2010)
Constructivism represents the social significance of the research as we study the reason why politicians choose to produce narratives that shape public opinion and set their nation for or against other country
