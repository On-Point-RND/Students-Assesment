Dear [name] [surname] Committee,
My name is [name], a second-year student of Economics, Finance, and Credit at [location] [university]. I am excited to apply for the [compaany] Summer School, as it aligns perfectly with my academic interests and career aspirations in integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into financial consulting and education. Below, I outline my motivation, relevant experience, expectations, and long-term goals.
Motivation: Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice
While my university curriculum emphasizes the importance of AI in modern economics, practical guidance on leveraging AI tools remains limited. Lectures often focus on theoretical concepts, leaving students without hands-on experience in applying AI to real-world financial challenges. As a partner in [compaany]'s «Svoy v [compaany]» project, I aim to enhance financial consulting training through AI-driven solutions. However, I lack the technical expertise to implement these ideas independently. The Summer School offers a unique opportunity to bridge this gap by combining [compaany]'s industry insights with advanced training in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL).
Experience with ML/DL Tools
Although I am still building my technical skills, I have taken proactive steps to explore AI:
Coursework and Online Learning: I completed introductory courses on Coursera (e.g., «Machine Learning» by Andrew Ng).
Collaboration with Peers: As part of a university team, I contributed to a research project analyzing consumer credit risks using decision trees.
I am eager to expand this foundation through the Summer School’s specialized curriculum and mentorship.
Expectations: Skills and Collaboration
I hope to gain the following from the Summer School:
Technical Proficiency: Hands-on training in ML/DL frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and their application to financial datasets.
Industry Insights: Understanding how [compaany] uses AI for fraud detection, customer segmentation, and personalized financial advice.
Networking: Collaborating with peers and professionals to exchange ideas on AI-driven financial innovation.
Career Goals: Transforming Financial Education
Long-term, I aspire to become a leader in AI-powered financial consulting. My goals include:
Developing Training Tools: Creating AI-based simulations and chatbots to train financial consultants in risk assessment and client communication.
Innovating at [compaany]: Contributing to projects that automate financial advisory services, making them more accessible and data-driven.
Promoting AI Literacy: Advocating for AI education in universities to prepare future economists for tech-driven challenges.
The Summer School represents a pivotal step toward achieving my vision of merging finance and AI. I am confident that the program’s rigorous curriculum and collaboration with industry experts will equip me with the skills to drive innovation in financial education and consulting.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
[name] [surname]
