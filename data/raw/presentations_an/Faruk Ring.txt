RIEMANNIAN FLOW MATCHING

Phd student, [compaany]
Introduction
How can we generate crystals, proteins, or robot poses that obey physical laws? Euclidean generative
models often fail—here’s how flow matching on manifolds fixes this.
o Standard generative models (GANs, diffusion) ignore geometric constraints.
o Solution: Flow matching + Riemannian geometry = physically plausible generation.
o Generative modeling on manifolds is crucial for scientific problems where data, such as molecules,
crystals, proteins, naturally lies on constrained spaces.
o Euclidean methods often fail to respect physical/geometric constraints, leading to invalid samples.
o Flow matching offers advantages but needs adaptation for structured domains.
o Applications, e.g. materials, drug discovery, robotics, benefiit from physically plausible generation.

Flow Matching
Flow Matching [1] generally:
Learn a vector field to map noise into data or more formally
maps arbitrary distribution 𝑝 to arbitrary distribution 𝑞 ~𝑝

Key Idea: find a time-dependent vector field 𝑣(𝑡,𝑥 )

which transports distribution 𝑝 to distribution 𝑞 ~𝑝 . !

Train with:
𝐿 = 𝑣(𝑡,𝑥 ) − (𝑥 −𝑥 ) $,

where 𝑥 ~𝑝 ,𝑥 ~𝑝 . I.e. parametrize vector field 𝑣(𝑡,𝑥 ) by neural network.

Inference (generation):

What is Flow Matching?
•Definition: Learn a vector field to morph noise into data (like diffusion, but with straihter paths).
•Advantage: Efficient training, exact likelihood, avoids diffusion’s slow sampling.
Flow Matching on General Geometries [2]
o A novel approach to continuous normalizing flows by extending flow
matching techniques to general Riemannian manifolds.
o The proposed method is not restricted to specific manifolds, making it
applicable to a broad class of problems in machine learning where
data resides on non-Euclidean spaces.
o Completely simulation-free on simple geometries, where geodesics
transports all points 𝑥 ≠ 𝑥 to 𝑥 at
are known in closed form (e.g., Euclidean space, hypersphere, exactly 𝑡 = 1. *(Fig recourse [2])
torus).
o On general geometries, it only requires forward simulation of a
relatively simple ordinary differential equation.

FlowMM: Generating Materials with
Riemannian Flow Matching [3]
o By operating directly on the manifold of valid
material configurations, the method
inherently avoids unphysical structures—a
common issue with Euclidean generative
models.
o Experiments on crystal and polymer
generation show marked improvements over
baseline methods (e.g., diffusion models,
GANs) in terms of validity, diversity, and
property optimization. The quantitative and
qualiative results are compelling.
o The approach is not limited to specific
material classes; it can handle a variety of Fig 2. A conceptual representation of the evolution from base distribution to target

representation of atom type. The highlights include symmetry-aware geodesic paths and a

FlowLLM: Flow Matching for Material
Generation with Large Languaage Models as
Base Distributions [4]
o The idea of using LLLMs as base distributions for
flow matching is novel and well-motivated,
particularly for structured outputs like materials
where LLLMs can capture high-level compositional
and geometric patterns.
o The experiments show that FlowLLM outperforms
baseline methods in generating physically
plausible and diverse materials, with quantitative
improvements in metrics like validity and property
optimization.
o By conditioning flows on LLLM embeddings, the
method allows for intuitive manipulation via

prompts or latent space interventions, bridging

(RFM) model to update its atom positions and lattice parameters. The atom
types are static in RFM. *(Fig recourse [4])
Stiefel Flow Matching for Moment-
Constrained Structure Elucidation [5]
o A key innovation is the incorporation of
moment constraints directly into the flow
matching objective, making the method
suitable for scientific problems where
partial structuraal information is available.
o The approach is applied to molecular
structure elucidation, where enforcing
geometric and statistical constraints is
Research gap
Unresolved Challenges:
o Noisy/Partial Constraints. Real-world data often has incomplete or noisy geometric constraints.
o Theoretical Guarantees. Stability and convergence proofs for flows on complex manifolds.
Why It Matters?
o Science Impaact. Valid structures accelerate discovery, e.g., catalysts, drugs.
o Industrial Use.
o AI Progress. Bridges geometric deep learning and generative models.
Future Opportunities:
o Flows for time-varying structures (e.g., proteiin dynamics).
o Combine LLLMs, physics simulators, and flow matching.
o Approxiimate geodesics or use symmetry to reduce compute.
o Flow Matching on Low rank manifolds (SVD, CPD, TT) to reduce number of parameters.
