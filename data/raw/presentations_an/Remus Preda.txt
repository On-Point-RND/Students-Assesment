Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the fatal cancers worldwide, making early and reliable diagnosis critical.
Traditional diagnostic methods are effective but require significant time, cost, and
expert interpretation.
Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for medical image analysis,
capable of detecting patterns beyond human perception.
However, Deep learning models lack transparency, which is a major barrier to
their trust and adoption in clinical practice.
Problem statement
Despite their accuracy, black-box AI systems provide no insight into their
predictions, limiting clinical acceptance
Medical professionals require transparency to trust and rely on AI-assisted
diagnostic decisions.
There is a gap between high-performing AI technologies and their real-world
usability in healthcare.
To bridge this gap, there is a need for explainable systems that can highlight
tumor regions and provide interpretable outputs to support clinical decision-
making.

Results
The IQ-OTH/NCCD lung cancer dataset contains 1,097 CT scan slices
from 110 cases, categorized into three classes: normal, benign, and
malignant. Collected from specialized hospitals in [location], the scans were
annotated by oncologists and radiologist to ensure clinical accuracy [1].

Limitations & Future Work
• The current model is based on a single dataset, which may limit the model’s robustness
across diverse clinical settings.
• The model classifies lung CT images into benign, malignant, and normal, but future work
could include more detailed classification across cancer subtypes or multiple cancer types.
• Integration with large language models could enable the generation of human-readable
diagnostic explanations, improving transparency.
• The system can be extended into a multimodal framework by incorporating clinical data such
as patient history, blood tests, and tumor markers to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
