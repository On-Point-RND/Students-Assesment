It is difficult to achieve
similarity between the results Extremely difficult to collect
of numerical modeling and thousands experimental Potenial outcomes:
experimental data because point for training a neural
fiber constants are never network
1. Recognition of regimes of interest
known exactly
2. Unique or rare events detection
3. Response function for reinforcement learning
4. Investigation of nanophotonic structures
CompeTent preprocessing, Based on the numeriallly
combiined with modeled data, it is possible
5. Can be combiined with almost all existing
augmmentation, helps to make to train a model capable of
machine learning and deep-learning approaches
the model resistant to such processing experimental
disagrreements data.
