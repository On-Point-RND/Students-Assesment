Introduction

Application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting properties of crystalliine materials

 Why is it important?
Traditional methods (DFT, experiments) are expensive and time-consuming
There is a growing demand for novel materials in energy, electronics, and catalysis
GNNs can acceelerate materials discovery by 10–100×
Background
Crystals can be naturally represented as graphs: atoms → nodes, bonds → edges
Models like CGCNN automatically learn structure–property relationships
Common data sources include Materials Project, ICSD, OQMD

Goal of the review
Explain how GNNs are applied to crystal analysis
Review model architectures, applications, and key results
Highlight current limitations and future development directions

Problem statement

What exactly are we solving?
We aim to predict the formation energy and other target properties of crystalliine materials based on their atomic structure —without relying on expensive quantum simulations.

Challenges

Complexity of materials: High-dimensional, multi-element systems
Interpretability: Hard to understand which atomic features influence predictions
Accuracy: high forecast accuracy is required

Scope of the work

Focus on crystal structures from public databases (e.g., Materials Project)
Uses GNNs like CGCNN with atomic and geometric features
Solves regression tasks (e.g., energy prediction)
Evaluates performaance on real-world datasets and discusses deployment prospects

Methods

Approaach: 
Machine Learning Techniques Used
Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN)
Based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with custom edge and node features
Implemented using PyTorch Geometric

Why These Methods?

Materials are naturally graphs: atoms = nodes, bonds = edges
GNNs capture local atomic environments effectively
CGCNN is state-of-the-art for crystal property prediction

How It Works 
The model learns to predict properties of materials by passing messages between atoms in a crystal graph, using bond distances and atom types as features.  
Data & PreprocessingInput: 
.cif crystal structure files
Extracted:
Atom features (from atom_init.json, e.g., electronegativity, group)
Bond features (41-dimensional vectors encoded in terms of radial basis functions (RBF) of the distances between atoms).
Constructed crystal graphs using neighbor indices (nbr_fea_idx)
Split dataset into train / validation / test sets
Normalized target property values

Slide 5
----------------------------------------
Results

Key Findings
CGCNN succeessfully learned from atomic and bond features
Achieved high accuracy in predicting material properties
Model generalized well to unseen crystal structures
Performance improved with proper normalization and neighbor count tuning

Metrics Used
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average prediction error (for Formation Energy - eV/atom)
R² Score: Indicates goodness of fit
MAE is preferred for regression tasks like energy or band gap prediction
R² provides intuitive sense of overall model quality


Slide 6
----------------------------------------
Results

At this stage, several key steps have alrreaady been taken:
•	Identified GNNs as a promising research direction,
•	Studied various existing neural network architectures in the context of predicting formation energy,
•	Created a GitHub project for ongoing development.

The LLM-assistant has been created to support users. It plays a crucial role in helping users quickly find guidance on solving their specific research problems using the project. This part of the project will also be developed and supplemented.

Slide 7
----------------------------------------
Research gap

 What’s Missing?
Limited to crystalliine materials with known .cif structures
Does not incorporate temperature, pressure, or defects
There are still few solved practical projects

Unresolved Challenges
Transferability: How well does the model generalize to other material classes?
Interpretability: Hard to explain why the model predicts a given property
Data quality: Ouutliers and inconsistencies in material databases

Why It Matters
Addressing these gaps can improve real-wrld creating of new materials
Better interpretability = more trust from domain scientists
More general models could assist in designing materials from scratch

Future Opportunities
Integrating defect-aware and different type of crystal lattice or amorphous structure handling
Larger and more diverse datasets
Combining GNNs with DFT calculations or physics-informe-d models
Exploring attention mechanisms for explainability
