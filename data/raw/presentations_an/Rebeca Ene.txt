Introduction
• Estimation of values and probabilities of extreme events is critical for safety
• Events such as floods, tsunamis, and wildfires are rare but cause significant damage.
• Events are rare so there is too little data to use classical machine learning methods.
• Models in High-Dimensional spaces contain many parameters, so classical statistical methods (MLE) are
not suitable.
Problem statement
• Develop multivariate models for the entire spectrum of distribution tails
• Prove the theoretical properties of these models
• Adapt machine learning methods for efficient parameter estimation
• Apply the developed models to simulate extremes in precipitation prediction
Statistical Model
• Gaussian random scale mixture models
• Random scale is a Weibull-Pareto R(s) random process
• Gaussian process is well-known standard gaussian process with Matern-covariance function
• Specific non-identical family of functions
• A theorem proven by me: This model is capable of modeling all possible behaviors of distribution tails, not
a subspace of it.
Neuro Bayes Estimators
• Key idea: simulate data with synthetic parameters, learn model to predict this parameters from
data
• Estimation of parameters via minimazing the following loss function
Neuro Bayes Estimators
Neuro Bayes Estimators
• Architecture for gridded data: CNN + DeepSet ( [name] et al. 2017)
•
Results
• Model is proposed that covers all possible types of distribution
tails
• Properties of this model have been proven
• Architecture for estimating the parameters of the original model
has been developed
• Successful experiments were conducted, and the model was
applied to real data.
Research gap
• In the future, it will be taken into account that real data is not independent, so seasonality must be
considered, and an architecture based on LSTM and CNN should be selected.
• A prior distribution will be chosen in order to introduce an additional scale parameter, and possibly,
reparameterization of the model will be conducted.
• Once the architecture accounts for the temporal structure, it is necessary to measure the results on
time series.
• Real data are not on a grid; weather stations are usually located randomly, so there are plans to
replace the CNN with a GNN architecture.
