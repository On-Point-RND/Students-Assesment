Introduction
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and challenging to predict.
Our goal is to build a deep learning model capable of forecasting short-term price movements using historical data from [compaany].

Slide 3
----------------------------------------
Data Collection
Source: [compaany] API (real-time and historical data).
Features used: open, close, high, low, volume.
Timeframe: 1-minute, 5-minute, or hourly intervals.
Preprocessing: normalization, outlier removal, time window segmentation.
Slide 4
----------------------------------------
Methodology
Models:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)
Framework: PyTorch
Target: Price N steps ahead
Training: MSE loss, Adam optimizer, early stopping.
Slide 5
----------------------------------------
Forecast & Evaluation
Metrics used:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Directional Accuracy (% of correct trend predictions)
Example performaance:
LSTM achieves ~65% directional accuracy on test data
Predictable horizon: up to 30 minutes ahead
Slide 6
----------------------------------------
Results
Neural models outperform naive baselines (e.g., moving averages).
Captures short-term trends effectively, though long-term forecasting remaiins challenging.

Future Work
Integrate external signals: news, social media sentiment.
Experiment with Reinforcement Learning agents for trading.
Add uncertainty quantification and ensemble models.
Slide 8
----------------------------------------
Conclusion
Our deep learning models show promising results in crypto price forecasting.
The project can be extended into real-time prediction and algorithmic trading applications.
