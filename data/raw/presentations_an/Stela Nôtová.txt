Sheaf Axioms on a Graph
Local Spaces Restriction Maps
Each vertex and edge is assigned a local For each incident edgeâ€“vertex pair, a linear
vector space map (restriction) is defined from the edge
space to the vertex space
Structure
Identity Axiom Compatibility Axiom
sheaf
The restriction of an element to itself is the Compositions of restrictions along adjacent
identity map elements commute
Locality Axiom Gluing Axiom
If two sections agree on all individual If a set of local sections agrees on overlaps,
elements, they are consideered equal there exists a unique global section
consistent with them
