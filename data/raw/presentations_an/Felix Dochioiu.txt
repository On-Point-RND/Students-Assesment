Dialog monoimage example
User: what is the buildiing on the image?
Model answer: The image shows [name]'s Cathedral, located in [location]. It is one of the most
famous and majestic cathedrals of the
city, built in the style of late classicism.
User: Which famous buildings in the
same style are located there?

Dialog multimage example
User: is these edible?
Model answer: Yes, these mushrooms
appear to be edible. However, if you are
unsure, it's best to consult a mycologist
or a reliable source for identification.
User: how about this?
