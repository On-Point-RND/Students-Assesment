The central dogma of molecular biology from the
school
● DNA stores genetic information and encodes RNAs;
● RNAs transfer information and encode proteins;
● Proteins are molecular machines of life!

Now it is a little more complex…
● We still have protein-coding
RNAs which transfer genetic
information from DNA;
3
Now it is a little more complex…
● We still have protein-coding
RNAs which transfer genetic
information from DNA;
● But we also know many
clinically significant examples
of noncoding RNAs which
have different regulatory roles
in cells.

How to study them?
Noncoding RNAs interact with
chromosomes in complexes with
special proteins to perform their regulation
5
How to study them?
So, we can find their regions
of interactions to interpret their
functions!
Some experiments are alrready
proposed.

As a result we have genomic tracks of contacts of
each detected RNA

What is the problem with it?
● Experimentally detected contacts are very noisy;
8
What is the problem with it?
● Experimentally detected contacts are very noisy;
● We need to find significant interactions - statistical approaches are used;

What is the problem with it?
● Experimentally detected contacts are very noisy;
● We need to find significant interactions - statistical approaches are used;
● But we also need noise estimation to define the significance of interactions;

● Noise track can be estimated from experimental data itself (details omitted).

Noise values distribution, high resolution
With higher noise track resolution
there are problems
Technical zeros are
overrepreseented and
some other artifacts
appear.

Our approach: learn ML model using other genomic data
● We defined 15 informative
features to predict noise;
● Task is a simple regression;
● Model will learn a part of
Noise Model
experimental noise which is
condiitioned on features;
● We can use its prediction to
impute noise track;
● As noise is a signal track we …
15 informative features
started with CNN on its
fragments.

Model shows good predictions results
● Many zeroes are not predicted as
we expected;
● Metrics on test are good enough;
● But we want model to be as simple
as reasonably possible;
● Do we really need U-Net?
16
Let's try classic ML models on table of genomic
regions
Models performance compared with U-Net
Model Test SCC
U-Net from previous part 0.739
Linear regression (L2 reg.) 0.669
CatBoostRegressor 0.707
● Classic ML models without region location information have worse
performance;
● Local features information is important;
● But maybbe we can add it easier than learning convolutions…

Let's add mean features in a window
Region specific
Now each region features vector
additionally has …

Train-val-test split is made
in a way to avoid any
possible data leakage
during feature aggregation 18
Now it’s much better, so U-Net is an
overkill for our data

CatBoostRegressor 0.707
LR (L2 reg.) with local means 0.715

2 layer MLP with local means 0.737
We chooose 2 layer MLP for its simplicity and 2nd best performance

● We learned 2 models on 2 different Target, 1st dataset
datasets (biological conditions are
Prediction, 1st dataset
the same);
Target, 2nd dataset
● Predicted tracks SCC is higher than
observed tracks SCC;
● Model learn common and
consistent features, which influence
noise level.

Future work
1. Research of some additional informative features;
2. Validate applicability of models predictions to estimate noise for significant
interactions search;
3. Broaden research to new datasets.
