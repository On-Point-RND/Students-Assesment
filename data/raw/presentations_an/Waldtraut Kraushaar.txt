Goal of the work
Goal: utilize different omics modalities on the
same set of observations to model an outcome
of interest
Why multiomics data fusion?:
Potential for making discoveries that are hidden
in a single modality, and achieving more
accuraate predictions of outcome.
Two types of existing approaches
Proposed cooperative learning
Cooperative learning
y – target, X and Z – data from different modalities, p – hyperparameter
p = 0: Early fusion
p = 1: Late fusion
Semi-supervised cooperative learning
The challenge of acquiring large-scale labeled
data remaiins, and there are cases where
multiomics data available but in absence of
annotated labels.
That's why semi-supervised cooperative learning
was proposed.
Semi-supervised cooperative learning
J – objective in the regularized regression setting.
Rewrited problem
Experiment
100 people: train / test = 75/25
The proteomics data contained measurements for 302 proteins and the
transcriptomics data contained measurements for 8,556 genes.
The goal of the analysis is to predict age using proteomics and transcriptomics
data and uncover molecular signatures associated with the aging process.
The researches artificially masked the labels for half of the training samples to
create a mix of labeled and unlabeled data.

Problem statement
Recent studies showed the possibility of extracting
SoS information from pulse-echo ultrasound raw data
(a.k.a. RF data) using deep neural networks that are
fully trained on simulated data.
But existing networks (default encoder-decoder) are
prone to overfitting to simulated data which results in
poor performance and instability when tested on
measured data.
Approach
Train 3 models simultaneously
with common loss function
Approach
And then combiine them into
one Encoder-Decoder network
Results, simulated data
AutoSpeed En-De Net
MAE, m/s 37,26 17,32
MAPE, % 2.39 1.11
RMSE, m/s 47,98 23,64
The error ranges of both networks are in the typical range of SoS errors (1 − 2%).
However, on the simulated data the En-De-Net has a lower error rate.
Results, measured data
Data was obtained with LightA BV S system
Since there is no ground truth value, the
researches relied on manufacturer’s
specifications.
However, if En-De-Net finds the area with
SoS contrast often the predictions have
clearer margins. AutoSpeed shows more
stable SoS predictions inside the inclusion
area but it is sensitive to highly reflective
scatterers

Problem statement
Existing approaches are oblivious to partial common
information shared by subsets of the modalities
A new framework can leverage the partial common
information microstructure of multiple modalities in
brain tumor segmentation tasks
Main contributions
The main contributions of the work are as follows:
– The novel PCI-mask and its online optimization to identiify partial common information microstructures in
multi-modal data during learning was introduced.
– U-Net-based framework utilizing PCI-masks and the self-attention mechanism to exploit the partial common
information thoroughly were proposed.
– Experimental results of the design demonstrate its effectiveness in handling brain tumor segmentation tasks
outperformiing state-of-the-art baselines.
Soft-HGR loss
Soft-HGR objective has been shown to extract hidden common information features among multiple
modalities more efficientlly
Masked Correlation Maximization
Authors modified Soft-HGR with adding s – selective mask vector, which elements in range [0,1] and s satisfy the
condiition:
which allow focus on at most c dimensions with the most valuable common information in feature representations.
Partial common information mask
Definition: PCI-mask as a m × m diagonal matrix diag(λ1, . . . , λi) with diagonal values denoted by λi, where i = 1, . . . , m
Previous problem can be rewritten in terms of PCI-mask as follow:
