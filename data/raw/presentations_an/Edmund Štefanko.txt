-Introduction
What are Neural Networks?
Neural networks are computational models inspired by
biological neural networks.
They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized
in layers.
Neural networks are used to solve complex tasks such as
classification, regression, and object detection.
Deep learning has revolutionized object recognition. However, deploying these models in real-world camera applications
faces significant challenges: Lack of labeled data, especially for novel objects. Limited computational resources on edg
devices. Sensitivity to varying environmental conditions. This presentation explores recent advancements in zero-shot
learning, knowledge distillation, and self-supervised feature learning, demonstrating how these techniques can overcome key
limitations in camera-based object recognition, paving the way for more adaptable, efficient, and robusst systems.

Bringing Powerful Models to the Edge
Motivation: Deploying complex deep learning models on resource-constrained devices like cameras. The need for efficiency

Key Article: Distilling Vision-Language Pre-training to Object Detection (CVPR 2023). (Cite here) Knowldege distillation
tranfers knowlge from a large, powerful <teacher= model (e.g., a Vision-Language Pre-trained model like CLIP) to a smaller,
more efficient <student= model suitable for deployment on edg devices.
Distillation allows us to harness the power of large pre-trained models on devices with limited computaional resources,
enabling real-time object recognition in challenging environments. This allows deploying accuraate object detection on low-
power cameras without the need for expensive GPUs on the edg.
