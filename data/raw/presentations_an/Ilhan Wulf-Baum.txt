Protein protein docking

So we have protein. But there is something better, or more precisely 2 proteins!

Machine learning models require numerical features as input, so the first step of all these methods involves convertiing the features into a format that can be processeed by the machine learning model. The features include the physicochemical properties of each protein and the topological properties

Why is it necessary to imagine two protein structures when there are single ones?Everything fits into one sentence - The connection of proteins with each other!that is, we can study how proteins will behave in connection with others, from which we can understand and create new drugs!
