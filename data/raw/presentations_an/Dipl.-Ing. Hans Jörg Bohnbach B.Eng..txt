Brief Overview of the
Problem
● How can humanoiid robots be
controlled in real-world settinings
for full-body tasks, with both
human teleoperation and
autonomous capabilities?
● Existing humanoiid systems
struggle to manage complex,
real-world manipulation and
movement tasks due to
stability, dexterity, and control
challenges(High DoF).

Why This Problem is Important
● Humanoiid robots have the potential to revolutionize tasks in
diverse fields (e.g., healtcare, manufacturing, disaster
relief) by mimicking human abilities.
● Improved humanoiid control can enhance productivity and
safety in human-robot collaboration, allowing robots to
perform tasks that would otherwise be impossible.

Background
● Challenges in Humanoid Robotics: Issues with stability,
precise movement coordination, and scalability of data
collection for learning.
● Q1. Can OmniH2O accurately track motion in simulation and
real world?
● Q2. Does OmniH2O support versatile control interfaces in
the real world and unlock new capabilities of loco-
manipulation?
● Q2. Can we use OmniH2O to collect data and learn
autonomous agents from teleoperated demonstrations?

Hypothesis
● Hypothesis: A universal control interface that combines
teleoperation and autonomous learning can improve
humanoiid robots’ ability to perform full-body tasks with
stability and dexterity.
● Goals - Develop a versatile control system that enables
teleoperation through VR, voice commands, and RGB
cameras, and trains autonomous capabilities from human
demonstrations.

Methodology
Pipeline:
● Data Collection: Use VR-based teleoperation to generate a
dataset (OmniH2O-6) of six everyday tasks.
● Policy Training: Utilize a teacher-student learning
framework with DAgger (Dataset Aggregation) and
reinforcement learning.
● Control System: Implement reward shaping, motion history,
and universal kinematic pose interface for stable, dexterous
control.

Results and Discussion
● OmniH2O outperformeed previous systems in both simulation
and real-world motion tracking, achieving higher success
rates, lower MPJPE (Mean Per Joint Position Error), and
greater stability under disturbances.
TeachResearchInnove
Limitations
● Odometry Noise: Robot root odometry is noisy and discontinuous,
causing deviations in motion goals during teleoperation.
● Safety Concerns: Lack of safety guarantees for extreme
disturbances or out-of-distribution motion goals (e.g., sudden,
large discontinuities).
● Limited Autonomy: Current system struggles with complex real-
world tasks like stair navigation using sparse input.
● Environmental Constraints: While robusst, the system’s stability
is challenged in highly dynamic or unstructured environments.

Real-World Applications
● Teleoperation Tasks: Perform dexterous loco-manipulation tasks like boxing,
hammering, picking objects, and precise tool handling using VR or RGB camera
inputs.
● Language-Based Control: Execute tasks based on verbal instructions, such as
“raise your hand” or “walk forward.”
● Stability Under Disturbances: Maintain balance and functionaliity despite
external physical impacts (e.g., punches or kicks) and on challenging outdoor
terrains like grass, slopes, and gravel.
● Autonomous Task Execution: Use learneed policies to autonomously complete
tasks like object picking, lifting, and game-like activities (e.g., Rock-Paper-
Scissors).

Future Work
● Teleoperation System Design: Enhance the system to
enable humanoiid stair traversal using sparse upper-body
motion goals.
● Improved Learning from Demonstrations: Incorporate
advanced sensors (e.g., LiDAR, wrist cameras, tactile
sensors) and develop better learning algorithms for
more effective humanoiid skill acquisition.
TeachResearchInnove
Conclusion
● OmniH2O’s design supports dexterous whole-body
manipulation, allowing seamless integration of
teleoperation and autonomous control.
