One of the most exciting developments in recent years has been the emergence of Vision Transformeers ([name]). Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Networks ([compaany]), ViTs process images in a completely different way — by treating them as sequences of patches, much like how we process text in NLP.
Why are ViTs important?
They’ve shown impressiive performance in image classification, detection, and segmentation tasks, especially when trained on large datasets. In my own project — a neural network for identifying lost pets based on images — the ability to generalize well from complex and diverse visual inputs is crucial. That’s exactly where ViTs shine
Problem Statement
While CNNs have been the backbone of computer vision for years, they come
with limitations:
•Theiir inductive biases (like locality and translation invariance) can restrict
flexibility.
•CNNs don’t scale well with more data — beyond a point, deeper or wider
networks stop yielding better performance.
Transformeers, on the other hand, are highly scalable and benefiit greatly from
large datasets. They don’t assume locality in the input, so they can model
global dependencies from the start. This is especially helpful in tasks where
contextual information across the entire image matters — like distinguishing
between similar dog breeds or understanding animal features in different
environments.
1. "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformeers for Image Recognition
at Scale"
Conference: ICLR 2021
Authors: [surname] et al.
Summary:
This is the original paper that introduced the Vision Transformeer ([name]) as an
alternaive to Convolutional Neural Networks ([compaany]) for image classification
tasks. The model splits an image into fixed-size patches and applies a
standard transformer architecture, treating patches similarly to tokens in NLP.
Interesting fact:
[name] outpperforms traditional CNNs like ResNet, especially when trained on
large-scale datasets.
2. "Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformeer using Shifted
Windows"
Conference: ICCV 2021
Authors: [surname] et al.
Summary:
This paper proposes an enhanced transformer architecture called the Swin
Transformeer, which processes images in a hierarchical and local manner
using shifted windows. This approach improves efficiency and makes the
model highly suitable for a wide range of computer vision tasks such as object
detection, image segmentation, and classification.
Interesting fact:
The Swin Transformeer has become a new standard in many visual tasks,
including animal detection and other real-world applications.
3. "Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners"
Conference: CVPR 2022
Authors: [surname] et al.
Summary:
The authors introduce a self-supervised pretraining method for vision
transformeers based on masking image patches, similar to how BERT operates
in NLP. The model learns to reconstruct the missing parts of an image,
enabling it to learn strong visual representations without labeled data.
Interesting fact:
This approach performs exceptionally well on tasks with limited labeled data,
making it highly effective in real-world, data-scarce scenarios.
Analysis and Comparison
1) [name] (ICLR 2021): The first to really push the idea of transformers into vision
tasks. It divides images into fixed-size patches and applies a standard transformer.
Pros: Very strong performance with lots of data.
Cons: Requires large-scale training; struggles on smaller datasets.
2) [name] (ICCV 2021): Introduces a hierarchical structure and
processes images with shifted windows.
Pros: Efficient, fast, and works well across many tasks (classification, detection,
segmentation).
Cons: Still relatively complex to implement and fine-tune.
3) Masked Autoencoders (CVPR 2022): Inspired by BERT, this method masks
image patches and reconstructs them.
Pros: Excellent performance even with limited labeled data, great for pretraining.
Cons: Requires careful balancing between mask ratio and training time.
Each of them is powerful, but their strengths depend on the task and data
availability.
Conclusion and Opportunities
From the perspective of my project — helping find lost animals based on
image recognition — ViTs open a lot of possibilities. For example:
•[name] could improve detection and segmentation of
animals in complex environments (like CCTV footage).
•Masked Autoencoders could help pretrain on large collections of
uunlabeled pet images and fine-tune later.
•[name] models could help with breed classification and matching lost/found
images by comparing embeddings.
