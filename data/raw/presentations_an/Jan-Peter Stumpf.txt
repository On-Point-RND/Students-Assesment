The Challenge: Dimensionality reduction in classical multivariaate settinings vs. functional (continuous) data Limitations of PCA when handling data with smooth, continuous structures 
Motivation: Need for techniques that respect the underlying continuous nature (e.g., time series, images) 
Real-world examples: biomedical signals, spectroscopy, and finance Problem Statement: 
How can we effectively extract key features from functional data while preserving continuity?

What is FPCA???
FPCA (Functional Principal Component Analysis) is a data analysis technique designed to deal with functional data, 
that is, data represented as continuous functions or curves (e.g., time series, motion trajectories, spectra).

----------------------------------------
Our Method & Novelty
Proposed Approach:
Extension of classical PCA to FPCA using smooth basis functions
Implementation using FDApy (a robusst FPCA library)
Key Innovaions:
Adaptive selection of the number of principal components to match the underlying data structure
Application across diverse datasets (toy problem, MNIST, multi-resolution images, HaGRID)
Systematic evaluation of reconstruction quality and classification performance
Novelty Statement:
Integrating adaptive component selection with functional data representation to enhance both interpretability and downstream task performance

Slide 6
----------------------------------------
Experiment 1 – Toy Problem on Noisy Polynomial Functions
Adaptive components
Exact Number of Components
FPCA with 8 components
Insufficient Number of Components

Objective - Test FPCA’s ability to capture underlying structure in noisy polynomial data
Concclusions - This analysis emphasizes that while FPCA is a powerful tool for extracting smooth functional components, its performance is sensitive to the choice of components and the relative noise level in the data.

Slide 7
----------------------------------------
Experiment 2 – FPCA on MNIST Dataset

Adaptive components
30 components
10 of Components
ConcConclusions 
FPCA can significantlly reduce the dimensionality of the data, when represented as functional, in tasks with real datasets such as MNIST, 
However, the task of determining the required number of components can be challenging because the algorithm is memory intensive and, in this particular situation, could not perform a decomposition explaining > 85% of the variance in the data.

Experiment 3 – Multi-Resolution Image Experiments (CIFAR-10)

Objective: This experiment aims to validate that FPCA can extract meaningful modes of image variation independent of resolution

Slide 9
----------------------------------------
Experiment 4 – HaGRID Dataset Analysis
Dataset: 
The HaGRID dataset consists of 1086158 RGB hand gestures images and annotaions, 
we used subset which comprises over 10,600 training images and 2,200 test images with labels from several gesture classes (e.g., call, dislike, fist, peace, etc.).

Challenges and Reproduction of FPCA Methods in High Dimensions

HAM10000, available from the ISIC archive, includes images of seven skin cancer types (e.g., Melanoma, Basal cell carcinoma, Melanocytic nevi, etc.).

Slide 11
----------------------------------------
Summary:
FPCA provides a powerful extension of classical PCA for functional data
Demonstrated improvements in feature extraction, interpretability, and classification performance across several datasets
Impact:
Enhanced understanding of the trade-offs in component selection and noise handling
Opens avenues for applying FPCA in diverse real-world scenarios
Takeaway:
Properly tuned FPCA can serve as a robusst tool in the analysis of functional data, with promising applications in image processing and beyond
