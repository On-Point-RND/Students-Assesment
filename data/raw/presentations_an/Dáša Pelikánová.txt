Co-crystals play an important role in many
industries, such as energy, electronics,
Introduction optoelectronics, food, and pharma, especially
There exists no open
platform for fast in silico Tabletability of therapeutic agents can be
screening of co-crystals achieved by co-crystallization
with target tabletability
profiles
Tabletability is defined by a set of mechanical
properties, such as plasticity

We selected 1.75M samples from the We retrieved mechanical properties for 6k
ChEMBL database based on the rellevant coformers from the Cambridge Structural
parameter distributions of the known Database (CSD)
coformers
Data
We used SMILES representations to We performed feature engineering and
extract molecular features with RDKit filtering as preprocessing steps

Training process
Generating process
Additionally, an evolutionary optimization module based on the GOLEM
Methods
framework was used to optimize the created molecules
We trained generative models on
1.75M molecules from ChEMBL
Experimental results
and fine-tuned on the curated 6k
coformers from CSD
We trained ML models and
selected the best one predicting
mechanical properties of
coformers
We employed evolutionary
optimization to significantlly
improve the tabletability profiles
of the generated coformers

Conclusion
We presented a generative pipeline for de
novo co-crystal design “GEMCODE” with
We demonstrated utility of the pipeline in
target property control
the Theophylline case study and
discussed its current limitations
We systematically investigated
performaance of its individual components
to achieve the best results
Experimentally validated coformeers improving drug tabletability generated by GEMCODE.
