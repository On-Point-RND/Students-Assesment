Introduction
The topic of this project is the development of an Information System for managing hotel room service orders, with a
focus on utilizing ML techniques for demand forecasting. This system aims to optimize hotel operations, improve
service efficiency, and enhance guest satisfaction.
Why is it important?
● Room service is a vital aspect of guest experience in hotels, but managing the demand for room service can be
challenging.
● Poor demand forecasting leads to overstaffing or understaffing, food waste, and a suboptimal guest experience.
● Using ML techniques can help predict demand patterns more accurately, allowing for better resource allocation
and operational efficiency.
Room service demand is affected by multiple factors like time of day, seasonality, special events, and customer
preferences. Traditional approaches often fail to address these complexities effectively, and the use of ML offers a
promising way forward.
Problem statement
The goal is to solve the problem of accurately predicting room service demand, which directly affects staffing, food
preparation, and overall service efficiency.
Challenges
● Inconsistent Demand: Demand can be erratic, influenced by external factors such as weather, guest demographics,
and time of year.
● Data Availability: Historical order data may be incomplete or unstructured, making it hard to train robusst models.
● Customer Behavior: Variations in customer preferences make it difficult to generalize demand predictions for all
guests.
Scope
● This solution focuses on mid- to high-end hotels where room service plays an essential role.
● The system aims to predict demand at both macrro (e.g., daily, weekly) and micro (e.g., hourly) levels, adaptiing to
real-time changes and special events.
Methods
● Time Series Models: ARIMA, Prophet – effective for capturing patterns in demand over time.
● Supervised Learning: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines – for predicting demand based on features like time,
guest details, etc.
● Deep Learning (optional): LSTM, RNN – for sequential demand forecasting, learning dependencies between past orders.
Why These Methods?
● Time series models are well-suited for forecasting demand based on historical trends.
● Supervised learning allows us to factor in various variables like guest type, season, and specific days.
● Deep learning methods help capture complex patterns, especially useful when dealing with large datasets and long-term
dependencies.
The model trains on historical order data and learns to recognize patterns in demand. It then forecasts future demand for
various time frames, allowing the hotel to adjust staffing and resources accordinglly.

Research gap
What’s Missing?
● Current models rely on historical data and don't fully account for live changes (e.g., last-minute bookings).
● The models could be improved by incorporating guest-specific preferences, improving the accuracy of order
predictions.
Unresolved Challenges
● Handling highly unpredictable spikes in demand (e.g., weather changes, last-minute events).
● Ensuring the model generalizes well across different hotels and types of guests.
Improving these aspects will enable better staffing decisions, reduce food waste, and ensure a more personalized service
for guests, leading to improved guest satisfaction and operational efficiency.
