Introduction
Objective: a new trading strategy using
machine learning and scalp trading
GANs Scalp trading RL
Limitations of day trading and hft
Day-Trading:
● Limited to few trades per day, reducing profiit potential.
● Relies on coarse-grained data (hourly/daily), missing microtrends critical for
scalping.
High-Frequency Trading:
● Requires costly infrastructure (co-located servers, FPGA/AASIC hardware).
● Focuses on subsecond arbitrage, inaccessible to retail traders and small
institutions.
Data
● [location] stock exchange
● LKOH
● 24 from April 2024 to 28 from
March 2025
● 1 minute 4-dimensional time
series: open, high, low and
close price

Reinforcement learning
Result
● At the moment, we are learning RL and we do not have the final results, in
general, we got a sharp ratio = 1.8 on real data. A 20% increase in quality is
expected based on synthetic GAN data.
Research gap
● Problem
○ long training time and instability of the model
○ time series limitations
● Next step
○ adding volume
○ complex GAN models
