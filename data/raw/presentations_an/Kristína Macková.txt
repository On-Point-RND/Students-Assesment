Pattterns detection in time
series using Clusterization
General Problem
Goaal: Find common patterns via clustering methods
Problem is motivated by [name].
Data preprocessing
● Data are collected during one particular event
● Data are obtained with random time steps
● The frequency of data collection indicates some similarity/difference in patterns
To overcome irregular time grid, we use following:
1) Divide data with chosen window_size;
one data in window_size - one sample
2) Use linear interpolation with chosen time_step
to get uniform grid
3) To analyse a few performaance features,
4) apply MinMaxScaler
DataSet have more than 100000 samples
Raw number of features: 400
Feature engineering
● The frequency of data collection reflects how often context switch happens — we
want to save this info in our model — domain-aware feature extraction
● However, applying linear interpolation reduces this info from raw data
● The main focus of clusterization stage — separate samples based on its dynamics
● Popular dimensionality reduction or signal processing methods on raw interpolated
data do not allow to achieve goal with suitable samples separation — no frequency
of events are used and too much feature-to-feature comparisons blurrs difference
between semi-constant patterns and dynamics one.
● Our main focus to analyze dynamics — need to overcome time shift problems
Feature engineering — my contribution
Construct feature space:
● use diffs of 1st order and sort them;
● use diffs of 2st order and sort them.
Result:
● Models are aware of dynamica
● Models are aware of frequency of events
● Models clusterize samples based on common patterns — no time shifts
