Purpose
The main purpose of this work
is to investigate the posssibility
of using artificial intelligence
to predict the morphology of
nanomaterials.
Main scheme of the project.
4
Objectives
Prepare the dataset by creating texts
from parameters and using statistical
testing for filtering unimporta important
parameters.
Use LLMs such as Mistral or
OpenaI’s GPT in order to
predict the shape of
nanomaterials from its
synthesis text by applying
few-shot method.
Develop ML models to predict the
shape and size of a nanomaterial from
its synthesis conditions.
5
Current research
So far, researchers have developed onl only a
few narrowlly focused systems for
nanomaterial size prediction [1].
LLMs have alr already found widespread use
in many areas of science and life and
even in materials science [2].

Conclusion
This work was accepte d for publication as a part of International Confere nce on
Machine Learning (ICML 2024). Preprint is currently a vaileble on arXiv.

Conclusion
Main results:
• Machine learning models were created and showed the importance of the same
parameters as in statistical tests. Average accuracy was 0.8.
• 6 LLMs were tested with few-shot metho d, and it was shown that this kinds of
tasks can be done with LLMs on par with classical ML models.
• The best LLM was GPT-4, althou gh the most interesting result is high scores of
Mistral-small model, as it is cheaper and faster than GPT-4.
