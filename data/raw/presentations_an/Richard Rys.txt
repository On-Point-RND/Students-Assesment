### Future Work / Limitations

*   **Application of a VAE for Depression:**
    *   Use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to extract latent features that are invariant to individual patient differences. This approach can enhance the discovery of hidden neural characteristics associated with depressive states and improve the modelâ€™s generalization across diverse subjects.
*   **Application of an Attention Mechanism for EEG Depression Analysis:**
    *   Employ an attention mechanism to identify spatio-temporal patterns linked to depression, focusing selectively on the most informative channels and time segments. This is expected to produce a compact model with few parameters that efficiently highlights key features, thereby aiding interpretability.
*   **Validation Needed:** Requires further validation on larger, more diverse patient populations (varying demographics, depression severities) to confirm generalizability.
*   **Interpretability Enhancement:** Improving model interpretability (e.g., via planned attention mechanisms) is crucial for building clinical trust and understanding the model's decision basis.
*   **Potential Enhancements:** Future exploration could involve:
    *   Integrating with other data modalities (multimodal approaches).
    *   Refining model architectures using techniques like VAEs.
    *   Further improve performance and clinical utility.

### Conclusion

*   **Strong Performance:** The proposed ensemble method (individual channel CNNs + metamodel) effectively classified depression using raw EEG signals.
*   **Key Metric:** Achieved a high balanced accuracy of 94.6%, indicating significant potential as a reliable diagnostic aid.
*   **Overfitting Mitigation:** Successfully addressed overfitting (crucial for limited data) using a two-stage training process combined with early stopping.
*   **Clinical Advantage 1 (Simplicity):** Reliance on raw EEG data simplifies potential deployment compared to methods needing complex manual feature extraction.
*   **Clinical Advantage 2 (Decision Support):** High balanced accuracy positions it as a valuable objective decision support tool for clinicians, complementing subjective assessments and potentially reducing errors/delays.
*   **Clinical Advantage 3 (Efficiency):** Meta-model architecture enables fast inference via parallel GPU computation, suitable for time-sensitive clinical workflows.
*   **Underlying Benefit:** Leverages the inherent non-invasiveness and relative affordability of EEG technology.
