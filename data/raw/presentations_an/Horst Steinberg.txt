What processes lead to deformation of the Earth's surface?
Seismic Volcanic
What information do the measured displacements carry?
What information do the measured displacements carry?
‚óè Such data provides information about geodynamic processes, including those occurring in areas of seismic and volcanic
activity. The main sources of field data are GNSS stations and radar imaging from satellites (SAR interferometry)
‚óè Displacements of the Earth's surface resulting from seismic and volcanic processes are steadily recorded by distributed
geophysical observation systems.
‚óè The task of interpretation is to determine the parameters and configuration of the deep source of deformations based on data on
reco—Äded displa—Å–µments on the surface.

Comparison of ResNet18 model predictions with ground truth values
Plots are sorted by target values (ground truth)
Useful for findiing outliers, and understanding in which area of the target parameter the predictions are better, and in which - worse
Inverse problem solution
‚ùñ Two series of numerical simulations were conducted to solve the inverse problem

of determining ellipsoid parameters.
‚ùñ The first series of numerical calculations assumed startiing the inverse problem
solution from a random combination of ellipsoid parameter values (from the given
range).
‚ùñ The second series of numerical calculations assumed startiing the inverse problem
solution from a combination of ellipsoid parameter values predicted by the
ResNet18 neural network model.

Inverse problem solution
Inverse problem solution
‚óè The issue of stopping criteria ‚Äì each optimizer has its own, and for a specific problem, the most efficient one
must be found.
‚óè The problem of evaluating the speed of solving the inverse problem: What should be compared when assessing
the acceleration of the solution?
‚óè Does the proximity of the residual in the displacement field imply proximity of the residual in the target
parameters? This is a key point in solving the inverse problem. When searching for a solution using iterative
methods, we minimize the residual of the measured field, whereas when training a neural network (NN), we
minimize the residual of the target parameters directly.
Conclusion
‚óè Two methods for calculating displacements in a homogeneous linear-elastic medium were compared: numerical
finite element modeling and the analytical McTigue model, for which a simplified method of accounting for
topo–≥—Ä–∞phy with variable souirce depth was used. Discrepancies between the numerical and analytical solutions
were more than 30% for vertical displacement and more than 45% for the horizontal component at souirce depths
of 1.45 km and 3 km, respectively.
‚óè A series of multivariate numerical calculations were carried out for the problem of an ellipsoidal inclusion in a
linear-elastic material with free surface topo–≥—Ä–∞phy in the form of a conica–ª relief with variable parameters.
‚óè Three neural netwoorks (CNN-based) were trained on the results of the numerical experiment; the prediction
quality achieved in solving the inverse problem was R2 > 0.9 for 5 out of 8 ellipsoidal inclusion parameters.
‚óè Two series of numerical calculations were conducted to solve the inverse problem of determining ellipsoid
parameters. For the chosen gradient-free optimizer BOBYQA, the effectiveness of using an initial approximation
obtained from the CNN inference results was demonstrated.
‚óè Using a model relief example, the possibility of effectively accounting for topo–≥—Ä–∞phy when interpreting surface
displa—Å–µments at various displacement scales was shown.
