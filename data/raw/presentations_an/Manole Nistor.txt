Long-term strength
● Property for material’s duration ability under operating
conditions
● Low Alloyed Steeels for Nuclear Reactors
● The operating times of reactors must be not less than
80–100 years, which complicates experimental studies
in the entire time range
Compound with advanced property
● Regression task: predict long-term strength by composition and operating
conditions
● Optimization task: interpolate the property to the area of unknown
compositions
● Trade-off: adequate error & optimization ability
Methods
● Approach: Genetic optimization of models ensemble.
● ML models for small amount of data in Material Science: Boosting,
SVM, RF, Linear
● Ensemble technique: train → compaare → build ensemble
● Data & preprocessing:
○ composition features selection using Feature Importance (DT)
○ outliers and features reduction using mechanical dependence
○ Standard Scaler for SVM
Material design pipeline
Results
● Candiate material with 325 MPa long-term strength increased by 9% compaared to
the best in the dataset with 12% estimated error
● Key findinngs:
○ domain knowledge for feature reduction
○ Nested CV to avoid error underestimation
○ optimization ability assessment before optimization of model ensemble
● Metrics used:
○ RMSE for better interpretability
○ r-squared for compaarison with papers
Research gap
● Discussion:
○ Extrapolation or Interpolation, actually?
○ Nested CV vs CV
● Confidence Interval vs prediction error
○ bootstrap variance estimate for each generated sample
