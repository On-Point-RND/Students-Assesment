Introduction
• The generative design of chemical structures with target properties represents a fundamental challenge in computa tional
chemistry. While this task is well-esta blished in drug discovery, where deep generative models (e.g., Variational Autoencoders
(VAEs) and Generative Adve rsal Ne tworks (GANs) achieve strong perf ormance due to abundant training data, polymer
info rmatics faces severe data scarcity. The a vailable polymer structures are appr oxi mately 10,000 times fewer than drug-like
compounds, funda men tally limiting model perf ormance.
• While VAE-based ar chitectures have been explored for polymer generation1, ex isting imple mentations yield subo ptimal
perf ormance owing to two key constraints: extreme data scarcity and nec essa rily compact model ar chitectures that avoid
ove rfitting but limit representational capacity.
Problem statement
• For generative design of polymers with target properties, we will engineer a latent space with three key
c haracteristics:
o Reconstructability: SMILES stri ngs must be decodable from latent vectors with high
fidelity
o Predictivity: Late nt representations must enable accura te property prediction
o Optimizability: The space must support derivative-free opti mization to navigate toward
desired property values
• Using this engineered latent space, we can generate polymers with target properties 𝑦 by solving the
∗
optimiz ation problem:
𝑧 = argmin||𝑓 𝑧 − 𝑦 ||
∗ ∗
(cid:3053)
• where 𝑓 𝑧 is the property prediction model, and 𝑧 is the optimal latent vector. This is achieved via
∗
derivative-free optim ization (e.g., Bayesian optim ization)
Data Augmentation
• There are o nly ~ 18,000 known structures for polymers which is not e nough to learn good models.
• First attempt to augment the data: training a BPE-tokeniz er on the a vailable dataset and random
concate nation BPE-tokens followed by fi ltering out incorre ct SMILES. Low diversity and low length of
generated polymers.
• Next attempt: full fine-tune of smiles-gpt2 (gpt-2 based model, trained on 10M c hemi cal structures
dataset) on the a vailable dataset. LoRA tuning was worse. Significa ntly better then pr evious app roach.
• Final app roach: Train small 5M decoder-only transformer on all generated pr eviously
structures.

Results
• Contrary to standard VAE training, we observed improved perf ormance by eliminating the KL-divergence term from the loss
function while preserving a reparamet erization trick, i.e. our model is some compromise between VAE and AE.
• To estimate the quality of final model several metrics were used: number of corr ectly reconstructed SMILES, number of valid
SMILES (decoder quality) and R2 of the target properties prediction (density, etc) based on the latent vectors. Notably,
XGBoost models consis tently outp erformed other app roaches in predicting target properties from the latent vectors.
