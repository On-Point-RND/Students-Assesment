Introduction
Topic: Fusion of Large [name] Models (LLMs) and Knowledge
Graphs (KGs) for Question Answering
Importaance: Enhances accuracy for complex questions by
incorporeating structured knowledge.
Background: KQA tasks require effective integration of textual and
structured graph information.
Goal: Evaluate how external knowledge improves QA performance.

Introduction
Figure: Quesrion example. Each question references multiple Wikidata entities,
and sub-graphs extracted from Wikidata provide the shortest paths connecting
these entities to the candidates.

Problem Statement
Problem: Selecting correct KG entities based on textual questions.
Challenges:
▶ Complexity in handling multiple candidate answeers.
▶ Misleading contexts when integrating external sources.
Scope: Leveraging external knowledge and uncertaiity estimation.

Methods
Approach: [name] models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG)
Justification: LLMs enhanced by external knowledge (Wikidata,
web-search, textualized KG) significantly outpeform standalone
models.
Intuition: Combining internal knowledge of LLMs with external
structured data provides more accuraate context.
Data and preprocessing:
▶ Textual descriptions from Wikidata.
▶ DuckDuckGo web-search results.
▶ Graph textualization via [name].

Proposed Approach

Figure: Approach structure.
Proposed Approach
Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Prompt an [name] with three sources
of external knowledge in separate ways: entity descriptions from
Wikidata, web search results from DuckDuckGo, and textualized
subgraphs from KG.
Answer Choice Using Uncertaiity Estimation. measure the [name]’s
confidence in the predictions for each knowledge source and select the
most likely one. The proposed White-box UE methods include
maximum likelihood and marginal likelihood.

Results
Figure: Evaluation results for two [name] scales. RAG denotes the knowledge
sources, where D refers to the textual description of answer candidates from
Wikidata, W represents DuckDuckGo web-search results, and G signifies the
textualized graph representation.

Results
Figure: The evaluation results compaare two strategies for combiing outputs from
three [name] models, each enhanced with diistiinct knowledge sources.
Figure: The evaluation results for [name] on the train subsets of different
populariity scores. The Wiki entity populariity is estimated by the number of views
of the correspondiing Wiki page per month for the first half of 2023 measured on
the training set.
[name] ( [compaany] ) TextGraphs-17SharedTask 2025 9
Results
[name] (70B) with web-search and Wikidata descriptions achieved
highest F1 score: 80.99%
Larger model consistentlly outperformeed smaller one, highlightiing
importance of model scale.
Adding excessiive external sources (graph) reduced accuracy.

Research Gap
Limitations: Performance drops when combiing multiple external
sources indiscriminately.
Challenges: Effective uncertaiity estimation and selective fusion.
Importance: Better strategies for fusion can further improve QA.
Future: Testing broader range of [name]s and integration strategies.
