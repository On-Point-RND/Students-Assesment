Introduction

Predictive maintenance (PdM) is essential for ensuring the efficiency of urban railway systems. Using machine learning (ML), predictive maintenance can help anticipate component failures before they happen, reducing operational costs and preventing unplanned downtime.

Slide 3
----------------------------------------
Problem Statement

The failure of key systems like the Air Production Unit (APU) in electric trains can cause major operational disruptions. The research focuses on predicting failures in APU systems using machine learning models to optimize maintenance schedules and reduce downtime.

Methods

The MetroPT dataset is used, which contains time-series sensor data such as voltage, temperature, pressure, and control signals from [location]'s metro system. Various machine learning models, including Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), and XGBoost Regressor (XGBR), are employed to predict maintenance needs.

Machine Learning Models

1. **Linear Regression (LR)**: A simple model for estimating dependent variables.
2. **Decision Tree Regressor (DTR)**: Captures non-linear relationships but can be prone to overfitting.
3. **Random Forest Regressor (RFR)**: Combines multiple trees to reduce overfitting and improve performaance.
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)**: Sequential models that correct errors from the previous models.
5. **XGBoost Regressor (XGBR)**: Optimized boosting model with better performance on large datasets.
