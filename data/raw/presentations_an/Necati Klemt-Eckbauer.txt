Introduction to RNN
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) differ from
regular (fully connected) neural networks in that
they process sequential data while taking into
account their temporal dependencies.
Features:
● Architecture
● Memory
● Applications

Introduction to Distributed Learning
Distributed learning is a method of training machine
learning models in which the training process is
performed on multiple computing nodes operating in
parallel.
Key principles:
● Fault tolerance
● Horizontal scalability
● Heterogeneity of computing nodes
Implementation:
● Choosing a strategy
● Creating a model within a strategy
● Training a model

Introduction to Distributed Learning
The multi-user mirroring method is a distributed training strategy in
TensorFlow that allows a model to be trained on multiple worker
nodes, each of which can have one or more devices (GPU or CPU).
Distributed Deep Learning Type:
● Data Split
● Shared Data
● Synchronous Approach

Relevance
Data Volume: Requires significant computing resources, which can be more efficiently utilized through distributed
learning.
Training Speed: Allows parallelization of computations, which significantly speeds up the learning process.
Scalability: Ability to scale horizontally by adding more computing nodes as the data volume grows.
Practical Applications: Network monitoring and security, content filtering, traffic management
