Mixed Geometry Tensor Factorization
Knowledge graphs
A knowledge graph is a data
structure representing knowledge
in the form of vertices and edges
of a graph. Vertices correspond to
entities such as people, events,
and goods, and edges correspond
to relationships between entities.

Tetrahydron Pooling Tensor Factorization
The model uses the embedding of
entities and relationships in a
Lorentzian space, which take into
account the hierarchical structure of
vertices and edges of the knowledge
graph.

Conclusions
5%
MIG-TF outperforms existing models on all datasets by on the
majority of metrics.
8
MIG-TF contains times fewer parameters than the existing the best
approach.
20%
The model requires fewer resources for training, since only of
the parameters are trainable in it.
