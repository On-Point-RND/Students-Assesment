ANONYMISED TEXT:
            
Surgery may be more dangerous than conservative treatment,
depending on the specific situation.
In case of aortic aneurysm:
Even experienced specialists find it difficult to
predict the risks of complications
Not all reasons leading to complications are clear
Need for additional automated risk
forecasting
And
search of all the causes leading to
complications
Current result
A working neural network capable of identifying various organs,
such as the stomach, in CT images, and also, based on the
resulting markings, building a 3D model
Result image
a system consisting of a neural network and algorithms for
constructing 3D models and analysis, allowing both to conduct a
complete risk analysis and to facilitate such analysis for
specialists.
Plans for the second stage
Getting a dataset from an abdominal CT scan

Additional training and configuration of neural
19.07
network parameters for marking up the received
dataset
20.07
Creation of 3D models and development of
21.07
algorithms for analyzing the geometry of models
22.07
Analysis of the received data, identification of
dependencies
