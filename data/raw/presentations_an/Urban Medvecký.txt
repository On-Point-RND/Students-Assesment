Developing a locator for the

Introduction
Vision is one of the most important sensory channels
providing perception of the surrounding world. It plays
a key role in spatial orientation, object recognition, and
movement coordination. Therefore, a violation or
absence of visual function leads to serious changes in
the functioning of the entire body.
Problem statement
Many people still face challenges due to vision impairment.
Traditional tools (canes, guide dogs) have limitations:
• Can’t detect all obstacles
• Expensive and time-consuming
Goal: Create a low-cost, efficient locator using microcontrollers.
Methods
Here’s how the device functions: The
ultrasonic sensor scans the area in front of
the user. If an obstacle is detected within 1
to 1.5 meters, it sends a signal to the
microcontroller.
The microcontroller then activates two kinds
of alerts — an audible beep and a vibration
motor — so that the user can safely avoid
the obstacle.
To keep the device running reliably, I used a
rechargeable 18650 battery. It charges via microUSB using a TP4056 module.
The MT3608 boost converter ensures that
all components receive the correct voltage.
A mini switch is also included to turn off the
device and save battery when it’s not in use.
Results
To summarize, a working prototype of a locator for the blind has been
created.
It’s affordable, customizable, and easy to use — and it has the
potential to significantly improve safety and independence for
visually impaired individuals.
Research gap
In the future, I plan to continue this work by developing a proper casing for the
device.
It should be ergonomic, lightweight, and provide protection to the internal
components.
Another important area is software improvement. I aim to implement algorithms
that can recognize the type of obstacle — for example, distinguishing between
walls, people, or soft materials like curtains.
This could help users better understand their surroundings and make more
informed decisions.
