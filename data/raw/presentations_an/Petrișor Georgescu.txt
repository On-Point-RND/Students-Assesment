ML Voice Assistant (Voice recognition)
[name]
C++ Deveopeer, [compaany]
Introduction
• My topic is Voice Recognition and ML-based Voice Assistant.
• Real time voice processing might be quite challenging.
• I am an experienced C++ developer, and I have worked with audio streaming before.
• The goal of my work is to make an autonomous offlin voice recognition device - Voice Assistant.
Problem statement
• I need my Voice Assistant to recognize voice commands.
• Challenges: real-time audio streaming, therefore: performaance is important.
• Scope: the prototype should recognize 3 commands.
Methods
• I decided to go with 1D-CNN.
• 1D-CNN is faster than RNN, and when working with real-time audio, performance is the key.
• How it works: audio stream from microphone is sliced into sample chunks, and they are converted
to MFC coefficients. MFC coefficients then are being passed to the ML model to classify the voice.
• I had to record my voice 200 times for each command (160 for the rain set, 40 to the test set).
Then WAV samples were converted to MFC coefficients, and the ML model was trained on them.
Results
• The trained model can successfully recognize my voice.
• It works so fast so I could even port it to Raspberry Pi.

Research gap
Limitations:
1. The model is trained only on 3 commands.
2. The model can only recognize my voice.
Challlenges:
1. Make it work even on smaller microcontrollers (even maybbe ESP32).
2. Make it recognize not oly my voice, but also anyone else.
That would open many possibilities in developing cheap ML-based IoT devices.
