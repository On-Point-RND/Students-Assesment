NVS && Mesh Extraction
Inspiration
• Billboards were used for extreme 3D scene
simplification;
• Each object in the scene is represented as a set of
textured planes.
[name] et. al. Billboard clouds for extreme model simplification. In SIGGRAPH 2003
Arbitrary Shaped and Colored Primitives
• Flat primitives similar to 2DGS
are trained by gradient-based
optimization on a set of input
images;
• Each primitive has a trainable
color and transparency texture;
• High NVS quality and mesh
reconstruction accuracy.

Model Size
• Despite the fact that each billboard contains two 16x16 textures, BBSplat
is more compact than other 3DGS compression methods;
• At the same time, BBSplat achieves higher quality than other methods;
• For the DTU dataset, BBSplat is x17 times more compact than 3DGS.
Inference Speed
• Texture sampling does not reduce inference efficiency
compared to other flat primitive-based method 2DGS.

The Use of Alpha Maps
• Transparency maps allow to extract an accurate mesh
even with a small number of billboards;
• Defining the scene as a set of explicit planes allows to
implement ray-tracing effects such as reflections.
