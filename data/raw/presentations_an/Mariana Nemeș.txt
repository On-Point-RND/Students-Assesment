Teams use real-time analytics to gain competitive advantage
ML helps make smarter and faster decisions 

What problems can ML solve in F1
When should a driver make a pit stop?
Will the tires last one more lap?
Which strategy is better depending on the weather?
Machine learning offers data-driven answers to these questions.
