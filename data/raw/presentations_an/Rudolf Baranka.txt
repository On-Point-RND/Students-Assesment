ZDNA
● Was first found in 1979
● Left-handed double helical structure
(the helix winds to the left in a zigzag pattern)
● Was linked to both cancer and Alzheimerʼs
Disease
● Still remaiins a mystery
Insufficient biologicaal data →
→ need for DL model

Interpretation
Pipeline
1. Chooose an input tensor from the interval which
contains target
2. Get a prediction from well-pretrained model
3. Focus on True Positive regions only

Feature Extraction
StatisGtilcoabla blased Naive Approach
● Ranking Stage ● Sort & intersect
● Extract
Robust, statistical based
Problem: No control

Ranking Stage
1. Get the average value of an interpretation tensor for each XAI method.
2. For each item in tensor, compute the percentage deviation of its interpretation score from the
correspondiing mean for each XAI algorithm. So, the interpretation values are transformed into
percent deviation scores now.
3. Compute the mean percentage deviation of each feature across all XAI methods. As a result, each
feature has itʼs own ranking value.
4. Sort the list of ranking values in descending order to get the most important features in the first
place.

Conclusion
In this project we :
1. Created the powerful CNN- and GNN-based models ConvMZC and GraphMZC for
ZDNA identification
2. Developed a framework, which includes an interpretation pipeline and ranking stage,
for the feature importance evaluation
3. Applied framework to ZDNA problem and extracted the relevant omics features
However, there are still more questions to be solved in the explainability of neural networks
related to bioinformatics, in particular. We will continue our research on the topic.
