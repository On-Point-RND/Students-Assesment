Introduction: Alzheimer Disease
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive brain disorder that impairs
memory, thinking, and decision-making abilities.
It involves shrinkage of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus —
regions responsible for processing information and storing memories.
Neurons become damaged and die due to the buildup of toxic
proteins in the brain: amyloid plaques and tau tangles.
These changes disrupt communication between nerve cells, similar to
how critical nodes in a computer network fail, leading to system-wide
malfunctions.
55m 10m 99%
people currently people diagnosed of Alzheimer’s
live with dementia with dementia annually candidate treatments
have failed
Problem statement
There is a huge number of targeted molecules for Alzheimer's
disease drug development, and the clinical trials required to test
them often take a long time
• In the 2024 Alzheimer's disease drug development pipeline,
there are 164 clinical trials assessing 127 drugs
• The total development time for a potential Alzheimer's disease
therapy to progress from nonclinical studies to FDA review is
approximately 13 years
