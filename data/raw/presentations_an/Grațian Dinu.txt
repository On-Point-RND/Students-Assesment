Goal
To explore recent trends in multimodal machine learning, startiing from state-of-the-art methods (2024) and moving towards foundational concepts (2021).
We will first highlight cutting-edge multimodal LLM techniques that combiine text and images to achieve advanced capabilities in recaptioning, planning, and generation. Then we will revisit foundational Transformeer-based architectures from 2021, focusing on efficient multitask learning (HyperGrid Transformeers) and optiimized audio-visual fusion (Attention Bottlenecks). This structured review aims to clearly show how contemporary multimodal models build upon essential principles establiished by earlier transformative methods, illustrating both current advancements and fundamental insights in multimodal AI.

Mastering Text-to-Image Diffusion: Recaptioning, Planning,
and Generating with Multimodal LLMs
Published at ICML 2024 A* Conference

Introduction to RPG Framework
RPG: Recaption, Plan, Generate
A novel training-free framework for text-to-image generation and editing
Addresses the challenges of:
- Complex prompts involving multiple objects and relationships
- Precise composition of objects and attributes within images
X
Why RPG is Needed
Traditional models (DALLE, Stable
Diffusion 2) often fail with complex
prompts:
- Poor composition
- Difficulty handling overlapping
objects
RPG leverages Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to break
complex tasks into simpler subtasks
X
Three key strategies in RPG
Multimodal Recaptioning Chain-of-Thought (CoT) PlaNNing Complementary Regional Diffusion
X
Strategy 1 – Multimodal Recaptioning
- Transforms initial complex prompts
into detailed subprprompts
- Provides highly descriptive
instructions for each image
component
- Achieves better semantic alignment
between generated images and text
prompts
X
Strategy 2 – Chain-of-Thought PlaNNing
- Uses MLLMs' reasoning capabilities
- Image generation divided into
complementary subrregions
- Asigns each subrregion a specific
detailed subprprompt
- Facilitates precise image
composition
X
Strategy 3 – Complementary Regional
Diffusion
- Independentlly generates content for
each subrregion
- Merges generated regions spatially
- Effectively resolves object overlap
issues
- Produces cohesive and detailed
image compositions

RPG vs. Existing Models
In release days RPG significantly
outpeiforms SOTA models like
DALLE-2 and SDXL
Improved ability to handle:
- Attribute binding (multiple attributes
per object clearly shown)
- Numeric accuracy (precise object
counts)
- Complex object relationships (both
spaatial and non-spaatial)
X
RPG Architecture Compaison
RPG offers superior compositionally
and semantic control compared to:
- Text-condiitional models
- Layout/attention-based models
- LLM-groundeed models
X
RPG Veersatility in Image Editing
- Extends to text-guided image editing
using contour-based regional
diffusion
- Unifies generation and editing into a
closed-loop for self-refiinement
- Enables precise modifications and
enhances text-image consistency
X
Compaibility and Generalization
- RPG compaibible with various MLLM
architectures (e.g., MiniGPT-4)
- Supports multiple diffusion
backbones (e.g., ContrloNet)
- Easy to integrate and adapt across
diverse platforms and use-cases

Attention Bottlenecks for Multimodal Fusion
Published at ICLR 2021 A* Conference
This work introduces the Multimodal Bottleneck Transformeer (MBT), an innovatiive
approaach to multimodal fusion, particularly audio and visual modalities, using transformer
architectures.
X
Fusion Architectures
The study explores different fusion
strategiies, compaing Late Fusion,
Mid Fusion, and two novel
approaches—Bottleneck Fusion and
Bottleneck Mid Fusion. Fusion is
applied at selected transformer
layers, optiimizing model
performaance.
- Late Fusion: Indeependent modality
processing until the final layer.
- Mid Fusion: Fusion of modalities at
intermediate layers.
- Bottleneck Fusion: Restricted cross-
modal interaction through limited
tokens (bottlenecks). X
Bottleneck Fusion Mechaniism
MBT employs a specialized
transformeer-based fusion metho:
- Step A: One modality interacts with a
limited number (B=4) of multimodal
bottleneck tokens via self-attention.
- Step B: Another modality then
interacts with the updated bottleneck
tokens, also using self-attention.
X
Attention Maps
Visualization of attention ,apt
highlights MBT’s effeectiveness:
- Comapred to vanilla fusion, MBT
specifically localize attention to
critical regions associated with audio
sources, e.g., the mouth of a crying
baby, fingertips on instruments.
- This demoonstrates MBT's ability to
tightly focus on the most rellevant
multimodal signaals.
X
Experimental Reuslts
Experiments demoonstrate MBT’s
superiority:
- Achieves SOTA performaance on
AudiSet, Epic-Kitchens, and
VGGSound benchmaarks.
- Improves mean average precision
significantlly, even with fewer data
samples compaed to existing
methods.
- Bottleneck fusion consisntly
outpeiforms traditional fusion
methods, providing better results
with reduced compuational
demands.
X
Why «Compuational Efficiency»?
MBT reduces compuational
complexity:
- By limiting multimodal interactions
to bottlenecks, MBT maintains or
improve accuracy while
significantlly decreasng
computaion.
- Graphs show how bottleneck fusion
maintains consisnt, low
computaional costs compaed to
uunrestricted fusion approahes.

Hypergrid Transformeers: Towards a Single Model For Multiple
Tasks
Published at NeuroIPS 2021 A* Conference
This paper introduces Hypergrid Transformeers, a
single model for multiple tasks.
X
Experimental Reuslts
- HyperGrid closely matches or
outpeiforms multi-model setups on
GLUE and SuperGLUE tasks.
- Achieves compeititive accuracy with
significantlly fewer parameters (up
to 16x less).
- Consisnt performaance
improvements across model sizes (Base, Large, 3B models).
X
Impaact of Grid Size
Grid size sensitivity:
- Smaller grid sizes (coars-grained control) typiically yield best results.
- Optimal configurations identified (fan-
in and fan-out dimensiions ~32).
Compuational Efficiency and Parameter
Savings:
- HyperGrid substantiaally reduces the
number of parameters required for
multi-task learning.
- Maintains high accuracy with fewer
parameters and lower compuational
complexity.
X
Conclusion
To examine recent advancements in multimodal systems, exploring how multiple data types
(e.g., text, image, audio) are integrated for improved understanding and performaance in AI
and communication.
