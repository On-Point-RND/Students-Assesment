ML Methods
Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
• Non-negative components that can be interpreted
as spectral profiles of individual porphyrins.
• Reprresents each spectrum as a linear
combination of a limited number of interpretable

spectral components.
• Ideal for spectral analysis!
ML Methods
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
How it works:
Why use t-SNE?
 Preserves local structure
 Highlights nonlinear patterns and
clusters
 Ideal for visualizing complex spectral
data
Data Preprocessing
Extraction of Porphyrin Spectra from Bacterial Spectra
Porphyrin spectra were extracted from bacterial fluorescence spectra by subtracting

the bacterial background, which was approximated using linear regression.
Train: baseline regions that do not contain porphyrin signal
Test: regions containing porphyrin-related fluorescence

Variability of Porphyrin Spectra
Across species Across biomaterials
Both porphyrin accumulation intensity and fluorescence spectral shape differ markedly across species and sample types
Extraction of basis components by NMF
NMF-Derived Spectral Components
Real Porphyrin Spectra
NMF represents each sample as a linear combination of a
small number of interpretable components.
Spectra were normalized before applying NMF to
focus on spectral shape only:
• Peak positions
• Relative peak amplitudes
Visualizing Species Structure and Spectral Similarity with t-SNE
Each dot = one sample.
Same-color points (same species) form clear clusters.
Spectral groups correspond to clusters of similar fluorescence profiles
DBSCAN enables unsupervised separation
of spectral groups
Classification model
Classification of 5 bacterial species – Multiclass Classification
StratifiedGroupKFold
Dataset split into train, validation, and test sets
function from sklearn
Due to class imbalance, macro-averaging was used for
model evaluation
The best performaance was achieved with
the CatBoost model.
F1-score = 0.84 on the test set
F1-score = 0.95 on the train+validation sets
