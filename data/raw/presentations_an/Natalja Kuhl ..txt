Tram Rail Segmentation & Rail Defect Detection

Introduction

What is the topic?
Tram Rail Segmentation: Computer vision for autonomous tram navigation by detecting rails
Rail Defect Detection: AI-driven inspection of rail defects using YOLOv8.
Why is it important?
Segmentation: Critical for autopilot safety in public transport.
 Defect Detection: Prevents accidents and reduces maintenance costs.

Problem statement

Challenges in Existing Methods:
Segmentation: Complex rail intersections and interlacing confuse models.
Defect Detection: Limited datasets for rare defects; real-world variability.
Scope:
Improve segmentation via active learning.
Optimize defect detection with hybrid datasets (public + field data).

Methods

Approach:
Segmentation: 
Active Learning:  Retrain on hard cases (interlaced rails).
Data Pipeline:  Video collection → annotation → augmentation → model training.
Defect Detection:
YOLOv8:  Pretrained on metal defects, fine-tuned with field data.
OpenCV:  Preprocessing (contour highlighting, noise reduction).
Justification:
Active learning reduces annotation effort.
YOLOv8 balances speed/accuracy for real-time use.

Results

Key Findings:
Segmentation:  Active learning improved intersection accuracy by 30%.
Defect Detection:  YOLOv8 achieved 92% mAP on field data.
Metrics:
Segmentation:  IoU (Intersection over Union).
Defect Detection:  mAP (mean Average Precision), FPS.

Research gap

Limitations:
Segmentation:  Rare edgge cases (e.g., damaged rails).
Defect Detection:  Lighting variability in field conditions.

Future Work:
Segmentation:  Simulate more edgge cases via generative AI.
Defect Detection:  Deploy on embedded hardware (Jetson).
