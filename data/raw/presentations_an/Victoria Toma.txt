Introduction
Goal:
Reduce the architectura l construction timeline and costs by implementa tion of generative AI to BIM
modeling
Key objectives:
•
Data preprocessing for the elaboration of brand-new storage type
•
Design the framework which automatically generates 3D Buildi ng Info rmation Models (BIM)
Scienti fic novelty:
•
Core methodology uses graph-based Industry Founda tion Classes (IFC) processing and information
extraction for the BIM model generation from the text prompts
Application:
•
Colla boration with industry partners to implement the model

Problem statement
The main goal is BIM data interpretation and the system of IFC code parsi ng
elaboration for the next aims:
1. Construction generation in BIM format from the text prompts
2. BIM data enrichment to fulfill the missing properties
3. Model information parsi ng from the IFC code
4. Questions answering with BIM data
6
Methods
BIM format contains following data:
- Geometry
- Relationships between objects
- Properties of objects and materials
- Project information
.IFC example:
Bridge model IFC-graph House model IFC-graph

Methods
IFC format contain the information about the objects,
thei r properties and the relations between the objects.
For the BIM enrichment the multilingua l LLMs were
used for the preprocessing and matching

Research gap
• Problem: Multi-agent system requires huge context for the agents communication.
Suggestion: Omit natural lan gua ge decoding and force agents to communicate more efficiently
• Problem: Existing datasets are suitable onl y for the civil buildi ngs (i.e., apartments) limiting generalization
Suggestion: Combination of novel benc hmark with various constructions. The IFC format is unive rsal, but
the data specific is unique for the one field.
• Problem: The Revi t software allows custom properties, which leads to unphysical properties in resulting
BIM models (e.g., water walls)
Suggestion: Train agent to revise the model formats and properties
