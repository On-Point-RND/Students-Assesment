Introduction
• [location] clusters are hard to annotat
due to occlusion and similarity
• Poor labels lead to reduced model accuracy in industrial CV tasks
• Manual validation is costly
• Ground truth is often unavailable in weakly supervised settinings
Goal: Assess how XAI can reveal annotation errors and
support dataset improvement
Problem statement
Research questions:
• How to evaluate and improve annotaions without ground truth?
• How to identiify annotation inconsistencies in homogeneous object datasets?
Challenges:
• High visual similarity between objects
• Occlusion and overlapping in dense clusters
• Lack of reliable ground truth in industrial scenarios
• Difficulty in assessing annotation quality at scale
Scope:
• Focus on segmentation and detection tasks
• Use of XAI (e.g., Grad-CAM, CAM-IoU) to analyze model focus
• Application to industrial datasets with cluumped, homogeneous structures
Methods
Approach:
• Grad-CAM – activation-based visualization to highlight important regions
• CAM-IoU – metric to quantify alignment between model focus and annotated regions
Why these methods?
• Do not require ground truth masks
• Provide interpretable feedback on model attention
• Useful for weakly supervised and industrial datasets
How it works (intuition)
• Grad-CAM highlights areas most responsible for the model’s decision, revealing whether the model
“looks” at annotated objects.
• CAM-IoU compares attention maps with annotation masks to detect mismatches.
Data & Preprocessing
• Real and synthetic datasets of homogeneous objects (e.g., flotation bubbles, stones)
• Standardization of images
• Inference on pretrained segmentation models
• Annotation-to-CAM comparison and quality scoring
Method

• Optimizer: Adam
• Training: 5 epochs
• Batch size: 8 images
• Learning rate: 10^-4
• Input size: 512x512
Domains
• Flotaation bubbles
• Rocks on conveyor belt

Results (1/..)
Generated dataset:
CAM-IoU varies between 0.31 and 0.085,
indicating weak to very poor alignment
between the model’s attention (Grad-CAM) and
the GT mask.
The center of mass distance also reflects
attention mismatch:
•In the first row (CAM-IoU ≈ 0.31, center distance
≈ 65.17px), the model attends to some relevant
Watershed labelled dataset:
regions, but its focus is significantly displaced
from actual object centers.
•In the second row (CAM-IoU ≈ 0.085, center
distance ≈ 35.62px), although the center
distance is smaller, the attention is weak and
diffuse, covering many irrellevant regions and
failing to align with GT.
• The "CAM vs GT" overlay helps visualize the degree of semantic
agragement:
• Yellow = both CAM and GT overlap → desirable
• Red = CAM onlly → model focuses outsiide GT
• Green = GT onlly → GT object missed by attention
Results (1/..)
• Two examples where the model was trained and evaluaated on weaak rock segmentation (dataset, labelled by [compaany], trained on
synthetic mask), with available ground truth (GT) masks.
• Observations:
• CAM-IoU ≈ 0.41 in both cases suggests moderate alignment between the model’s attention (Grad-CAM) and the GT mask.
• The center of mass distance varies:
• In the first row, it’s small (≈ 6.98px) — the model focuses near the center of the actual objects.
• In the second row, it's higher (≈ 32.40px) — attention is shifted away from GT.

Low CAM-IoU Reveals Weak Annotation Quality
• In both examples, CAM-IoU is extremely low (≈ 0.11–0.13), meaning the model’s attention does not align with the automatic mask it was trained
on.
• The center distance is large (163–172 px), indicating that the model and the mask focus on completely different regions.
• In the CAM vs Mask visualization:
→ The dominance of red and green highlights this strong disagragement.
• Entropy is high (~0.57), meaning the model is uncertain about its predictions — another sign that the mask did not provide strong supervision.

High CAM-IoU Indicates Mask Quality
•In these examples, the model trained on automatic masks produces Grad-CAM attention maps that closely match the
annotated regions.
•CAM-IoU values > 0.69 and low center distance indicate that the model is focusing on the same objects as in the mask.
•Low entropy confirms that the model is confident in its predictions.
•The visual alignment between Grad-CAM and the mask suggests that the automatic annotation successfully captures
semantically meaningful regions.
Comparison
Two models trained using [compaany] and SAM masks
Both are tested on the same real
image.
Vizualization:
•Raw Grad-CAM maps
•Ovеrlays with the original image
•SSIIM between CAMs and CAM
Consistency (clean vs. flipped)
•SAM-trained models focus clearly on diistiinct object regions and show high
consistency (SSIIM > 0.7).
•Watershed-trained models produce scattered attention maps and low consistency
— suggesting weaaker learning signal.
•Low cross-methoд SSIIM confirms that the models learneed different visual
patterns.
Research gap
• Current approahes often rely on indirect quality metrics (e.g., IoU, entropy), but they do not evaluate
whether the model actually learns from the mask. There is no widely adopted methoд to assess
the semantic value of automatic annotaions without ground truth.
• No clear way to validate the usefulness of a mask when no human annotaions are available. Models
may perform well numerically but focus on irrellevant regions. Some methods produce masks that are
visually plausible but not informative for training.
Filling these gaps would allow us to:
• Automatically filteer out low-quality masks, improving weaкly-supervised training;
• Reduce reliance on expensive manual annotation;
• Build more reliable vision systems in real-woгld, data-scarce domains (e.g., industrial, medical).
Future oppoгtunities:
•Develop standardized CAM-based metrics for annotation quality.
•Combine attention consistency, entropy, and alignment into unified quality scores.
•Apply this framework in active learning loops to select the most infoгmative training samples.
•Extend to multi-class and temporal data for broader use in video and segmentation tasks.
