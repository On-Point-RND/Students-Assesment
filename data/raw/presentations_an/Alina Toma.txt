Introduction
Topic:
Application of machine learning in modern astronomy
using data from the SRG/eROSITA X-ray survey.
Importance:
Astronomy faces a data explosion — high-volume,
high-dimensional, heterogeneous datasets require new
analysis methods. Machine learning enables
automations and discoveries in this complex
environment.
Background:
The SRG observatory ([location–[location]) performs an
all-sky X-ray survey. Our team uses machine learning
tools, such as the SRGz system, to identify and analyze
sources like distant quasars and X-ray stars.
Goal:
To demonstrate how machine learning helps solve key
challenges in the analysis of SRG/eROSITA data and to
outline its potential for improving source classification,
redshift estimation, and physical parameter inference.
SRG/eROSITA survey
Problem Statement
What exactlly are we solving?
We are tackling the challenges of processing and analyzing massive, high-dimensional astronomiical datasets. In particular, we are
working with extensive catalogs of X-ray sources and need to automate the process of gathering and analyzing diverse types of data,
including photometric and spectroscopic optical data, information from various astronomiical databases such as [compaany], [compaany], and
[compaany], as well as our own observations from the [location] telescope RTT-150.
Challenges:
● Data Heterogeneity and Noise: Data from different telescopes and surveys vary in format, quality, and resolution, making it
difficult to merge them into a unified dataset.
● Identifying Rare or Transient Phenomena: The SRG mission is designed to detect faint and rare objects, such as distant quasars.
Spotting and analyzing these events amidst the noise is a significant challenge.
● Large-scale Data Analysis: Efficient algorithms are necessary to process large volumes of data and extract meaningful results,
such as determining redshifts, classifying stars, and understanding the nature of X-ray emissions.
Scope:
The project involves working with large catalogs of X-ray sources obtained from five all-sky surveys conducted by the eROSITA
telescope ([location] space observatory). These surveys cover a broad spectrum of objects in the X-ray range and aim to determine the nature
of X-ray radiation. This will help us gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of Universe.
Approach:
Methods
The SRGz system uses a combination of probabilistic models and machine
learning techniques for cross-matching X-ray sources from the SRG/eROSITA
mission with optical counterparts. Specifically, it utilizes decision trees, random
forests, and probabilistic classifiers to handle the large-scale, multi-dimensional
nature of the data.
Why these methods?
These methods were chosen for their ability to handle complex, noisy, and
heterogeneous data. Decision trees and random forests are well-suited for
classification tasks, as they can manage missing data and non-linear
relationships. Probabilistic models enable accurate estimation of the likelihood of
source matching, which is essential in identifying distant quasars and other rare
objects in the vast SRG dataset.
How it works:
The SRGz system operates by analyzing the X-ray flux and the optical
counterparts of detected sources. It assigns a probability score for each potential
match, which helps in the precise identification of celestial objects. The results are published in two articles:

Results
The analysis of distant quasars detected by the SRG Observatory and observed using the [location] telescope resulted in significant
advancements in the determination of spectroscopic redshifts. Our approach, using the SRGz system, allowed for precise matching of X-ray
sources with optical counterparts, enabling reliable redshift measurements.
1. First Paper (I):
This study focused on the spectroscopic redshift determination for a sample of distant quasars identified through SRG/eROSITA
observations. The SRGz system, developed for cross-matching X-ray and optical data, played a pivotal role in achieving these results,
providing more accurate redshift values and improving the understanding of the large-scale structure of the universe.
2. Second Paper (II):
In the follow-up study, the methods were extended to a larger sample, allowing for a broader analysis of the quasar population. The
refined techniques led to the identification of additional quasars and further improved redshift determinations, shedding light on the
distribution of distant quasars in the universe.
Key Findings:
● Accurate Redshift Measurements: Enhanced understanding of distant quasar p populaions and their role in cosmic evolution.
● Improved Data Processing: The integration of SRGz in the workflow led to more efficient and precise analysis of large datasets.
These studies contribute significantlly to the ongoing efforts to map the universe through the SRG mission, providing valuable insights into the
distribution of quasars and their role in the cosmic evolution.

Research Gap
What’s Missing?
While SRGz has proven effective for identifying distant quasars, current methods are still limited in their application to other types of celestial
objects, such as X-ray emitting stars. The system primarily focuses on probabilistic cross-identification and redshift estimation, but lacks
comprehensive tools for physical parameter inference and spectral classification across broader source p populaions.
Unresolved Challenges:
● Scalability and Generalization: Current algorithm are optimized for quasars but are not yet adapted for heterogeneous sources such as
stars with varying X-ray properties.
● Incomplete Infoirmaation Integration: Automated pipelines for integrating photometric, spectroscopic, and multi-catalog data ([compaany],
[compaany], [compaany]) are still under development.
● Physical Interpretaion: There is still no robust system for deriving stellar physical parameters or understanding the physical origin of
X-ray emission across diverse star types.
Why It Matters:
Filling these gaps would enable more efficient and accurate classification and analysis of millions of X-ray sources, helping to uncover the nature
of their emission and contributing to our understanding of stellar evolution and galactic structure. Automating these processes is essential given the
scale of current and future datasets.
Future Opportunities:
● Develop and apply ML models for spectral classification of X-ray stars.
● Automate the collection of complementary data from multiple surveys and literature.
● Create algorithm to derive physical parameters (e.g., temperature, mass, luminosity) from
multiwavelength data.
● Investigate the nature of X-ray emission mechanisms through statistical and ML-driven analyses.
● Integrate these tools into scalable pipelines to support future SRG data releases and follow-up
programs.
