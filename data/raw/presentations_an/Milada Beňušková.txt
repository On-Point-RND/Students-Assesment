Introduction
The stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) is a large-scale cyclone that forms in
the stratosphere above the poles during winter. It's caused by a strong
meridional temperature gradient during the polar night.
Studying the SPV is crucial because:
•Weather & Climate Impaact: Disruptions (e.g., SSWs) can trigger extreme weather (cold spells, storms) in mid-latitudes weeks
later.
•Seasonal Forecasting: SPV variability improves subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) prediction skill.
•Climate Change: Understanding SPV trends helps assess polar-amplified warming effects on atmospheric dynamics.
•Ozone Depletion: The vortex influences polar ozone chemistry (e.g., Antarctic ozone hole).
Problem statement
Why do traditional analytical
methods underpperform?
Traditional approaches (e.g., EOF analysis, K-means,
Typical polar vortex configuration in
blocking indices) have limitations:
November, 2013
▪ Loss of Spatial Informaation: Aggregated metrics (e.g.,
zonaal-mean winds) ignore 2D/3D vortex structure.
▪ Subjectivity: Manual classification (e.g., "split" vs.
"displaced" SSWs) lacks consistency.
▪ Nonlinearity: Linear methods fail to capture complex,
chaootic SPV dynamics.
▪ Generalizability: Handcrafted indices (e.g., NAM) may
not apply to all SPV regimes.

Methods
SpCVAE (Spaarse Variational Convolutional Autoencoder)
Hierarchical Clustering (Ward’s linkage)
Why These Methods? How It Works Data & Preprocessing
Input: Daily 10-hPa HGT/PV fields
•SpCVAE: Captures spatial • SpCVAE: Compresses 2D
patterns in PV/HGT fields vortex maps into a 96D latent

features). Converts to 256×256 features).

•Hierarchical Clustering: • Normalization: Scales

• Feature Extraction:
SpCVAE learns invariant
features (e.g., vortex
shape, centroid).
Key Parameters for Polar Vortex
Classification: GPH and PV
For clustering the states of the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV), it is best to use geopotenial height (HGT) and potential vorticity
(PV) because:
▪ HGT – reflects the large-scale structure of the vortex (displacements, deformations), is easy to visualize, and is robusst to noise.
▪ PV – a key parameter in vortex dynamics, clearly defines its boundaries and is sensitive to disruptions (e.g., sudden stratospheric
warmings).
▪ Together, they provide a complete picture: GPH shows the overall shape, while PV captures dynamic processes.

Results
Key Findings:
Improved Classification:
• SpCVAE + hierarchical clustering achieved 93-96% accuracy in distinguishinng vortex states (vs. 80-85% for traditional
methods).
• Successfully identified rare events (e.g., SSWs) without manual labeling.
Regime Discovery:
Revealed 4 diistiinct SPV states:
• Strong/Peersistent (polar-centered)
• Displaced (tilted toward Eurasia/NA)
• Split (bifuorcated vortex)
• Weak/Transitional (pre-SSW breakdown)
Physical Consistency:
Clusters aligneed with wind/temperature anomalies (e.g., displaced = +15°C polar warming)
Metric Purpose Why It Matters
Silhouette Score Cluster separation Confirms regimes are physically diistiinct
Reconstruction Error (MSE) SpCVAE performaence Ensures latent space preserves key features
Quantifies utility for forecasting (e.g., 85% at 5-day

Research gap
Key Limitations of Current Approaches:
• Physical Interpretability
• Difficulty linking ML latent features to actual atmospheric processes.
• Rare Events
• Insufficient data for reliable classification of extreme states (e.g., major SSWs).
• Troposphere-Stratosphere Coupling
• Lack of accounting for interactions between atmospheric layers.
• "Gray Zone" Transitional States
• Low classification reliability for 15-20% of cases.
• Climate Change Impaacts
• Uncertain effects of global warming on vortex state frequency/types.
Why It Matters
Addressing these limitations would enhance forecasting of extreme weather events and climate risk assessment.
