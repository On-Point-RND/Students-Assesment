Introduction
• Barycenteer estimation with optimal transport (OT).
• OT barycenteers have applications in graphics, generative modeling, clustering, etc.
• Computing OT barycenteers is computationally expensive and often unstable.
• Review and reproduce results of the Wassersteiin Iterative Networks (WIN) approaach.
Problem statement
• What exactlly are we solving? Estimating Wassersteiin barycenteers of multiple distributions efficientlly and
accurately.
• Challenges:
High computational cost of OT.
Stability and convergence issues.
Difficulty scaling to high dimensions.
• Scope: Focus on comparing WIN against baselines on synthetic datasets.
Methods
Approach: Neural network-based optimization to approximate Wassersteiin barycenteers.
• Why these methods? Briefly justify your choices.
Neural networks are highly scalable and flexible.
Iterative refiinement improves accuracy over simple feedforward models.
• How it works (simply): Give a 1–2 line intuition:
WIN iteratively refines the barycenteer by alternating between transport and barycenteer update steps
using a learned neural model.
•Data & preprocessing: Mention key steps like cleaning data, feature extraction, or splitting into
train/test sets.
Synthetic datasets: Gaussian mixtures, blob clusters.
Data normalized to [0,1] range.
No complex preprocessing needed.
Results
• Key findiings: Summarize the outcomes.
WIN achieves lower barycenteer loss compared to Sinkhorn algorithm and fixed solvers.
WIN converges faster and scales better to complex datasets.
• Metrics used: Mention evaluation metrics and why they matter:
Wassersteiin distance between predicted and ground truth barycenteers.
Visual evaluation (plots of barycenteers).
Research gap
• What’s missing? Identify limitations in current approaches:
The method is currentlly limited to synthetic 2D and low-dim distributions:
• Unresolved challenges: Mention problems that still exist:
Extending WIN to high-dimensional real-world distributions (e.g., images, 3D shapes).
• Why it matters? Explain how filling these gaps could improve real-world use:
Real-world data rarely lies in low-dimensional spaces.
• Future opportunities: Suggest next steps:
Combining WIN with generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) for large-scale applications.
Exploring hierarchical barycenteers for better scalability.
