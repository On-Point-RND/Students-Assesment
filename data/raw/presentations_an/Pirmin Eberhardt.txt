Many RNAs do not encode proteins and play a regulatory role insteaad
Experimental data about protein-RNA interactions lacks too much

Formally, it’s just binary classification
For each protein we
want to train an
independent model
that takes RNA
features as input and
predicts probability
that this RNA binds
the protein.
How do we process RNA sequence?
First idea: standard NLP
approaches.
AUCACACAC...AAU
But what if we will try to take
into
account the specifics of the
biological domain?
What makes biological sequences so special?
Extremely small alphabet: {A, U, G, C
Proteins usually bind RNAs by
recognizing a small “subword” in a big
RNA “word”
Why not to directly count all possible subwords?
Such subwords of a given length (and alphabet) are called kmers.
We count all 3-mers and 5-mers and thus obtain a - dim
vector representation. We also fix the length of RNA to 200.
Probably, we can’t afford such a huge representation
Such subwords of a given length (and alphabet) are called kmers.
Taking into consideration that for most of proteins available data consists of
~100`000 examples, input size in 1088 is too large (# params >> # examples).
Hashing: reducing the dimenshionality in a non-parametric way
AUCACACAC...AAU Our hashing can be expressed as a
column-stochastic linear operator.
Consider a low-dimensional example:

raeniL
ULeR
tuoporD

 hash

499 x 512 512 x 256 256 x 128 128 x 1
fcnn_layer
Results
RNAs of arbitrary length can be splitted into bins of length 200. Then model
independentlly assigns a binding probability for each bin.
Results
Hashing not only reduces the embedding size, but improves quality.
Results
Our models outperform more sophisticated existing approaches.
Gaps & future work
false positive
interpretation will allow us to figure out essential kmers and calculate only
theiir frequencies, on the basis of it we can construct a distilled mode
probably, via hashing we can afford to calculate frequencies of kmers for
k >
Is MLP really the best choice?
