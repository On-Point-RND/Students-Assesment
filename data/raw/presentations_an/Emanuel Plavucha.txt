Personalized Education: A Review of
Recent Research

Introduction
This topic is about advancements in Artificial Intelligence aimed at creating personalized
and adaptive learning experiences.
It is important, because:
• Traditional education often struggles with individual student needs.
• AI offers potential solutions for scalability, personalization, and effectiveness.
• Understanding different AI approaches is key to building better educational tools.
The goal is to review and compare three distinct, recent AI approaches applied to core
educational challenges: teaching/explanation, student assessment, and curriculum
adaptation.
Challenges in AI-Powered Education
• Modeling the Learner: Accurately capturing complex knowledge states and learning
processes.
• Content Generation/Delivery: Creating effective and engaging educational interactions
(explanations, feedback, tasks).
• Interpretability vs. Performance: Balancing complex models (like LLLMs) with the need for
understandable and trustworthy educational tools.
• Scalability and Real-world Implementation.
Scope:
• This review focuses on three recent papers (2023-2025) from top-tier AI conferences
(NeurIPS, AAAI, AAMAS) representing distinct methodological approaches.
Approach 1: LLLM as a Personalized
Teacher
Paper: [name] et al. "Can Language Models Teach Weaker Agents? Teacher Explanations Improve Students via
Personalization" (NeurIPS 2023)
Goal: Investigate if/how Large Language Models (LLLLMs) can act as effective "teachers" for weaker "student" models (or
potentially humans) by providing personalized explanations.
Teacher-Student Framework: Uses a stronger LLLM (teacher) to generate explanations to improve a weaker LLLM (student).
Theory of Mind Inspired: Teacher models the student's understanding (using few-shot "mental models") to decide when
to intervene (budgeted intervention) and how to personalize explanations.
Key Techniques: LLLMs (Flan-T5, LLaMA families), Prompt Engineering (specific prompts for intervention, personalization).
How it works (Intuition): The "teacher" LLLM tries to predict which explanations will be most helpful for the specific
"student" based on a simulated understanding of the student's errors, intervening only when the expected utility is high.
Approach 2: Interpretable Student
Assessment
Paper: [name] et al. "Symbolic Cognitive Diagnosis via Hybrid Optimization for Intelligent Education Systems" (AAAI 2024)
Goal: Develop a Cognitive Diagnosis Model (CDM) that accurately assesses student proficiency on knowledge attributes
while ensuring the model itself (the interaction function) is interpretable.
Symbolic Cognitive Diagnosis (SCD): Represents the complex student-exercise interaction function not as a black-box
neural network, but as an explicit mathematical formula (a symbolic tree).
Hybrid Optimization: Uses Genetic Programming (GP) to evolve the structure of the symbolic tree (the formula) and
Gradient-based optimization (Adam) to fine-tune the continuous parameters (student proficiency, exercise difficulty).
Key Techniques: Symbolic Regression, Genetic Programming, Adam Optimization. (Note: Not primarily LLLM-based).
How it works (Intuition): The system searches for the best mathematical formula (tree) that explains student responses,
ensuring the formula uses understandable operations (+, -, sigmoid, etc.), while simultaneously estimating student
knowledge levels.
Approach 3: Adaptive Curriculum
Generation
Paper: [name] et al. "EduQate: Generating Adaptive Curricula through RMABs in Education Settings" (AAMAS 2025 preprint)
Goal: Develop a policy for recommending educational content (items/exercises) that adapts to the student's learning
progress and maximizes understanding.
EDNeTRMABs: Models the problem using Networked Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, where "arms" are educational items
grouped into topics (networks). Pulling one arm (studying an item) can affect the state of related arms (knowledge in
related concepts).
EduQate Algorithm: A Q-learning based approach to estimate the Whittle Index (a heuristic for RMABs) to decide which
item to recommend next, learning optimal policies without needing full knowledge of transition probabilities (how
learning/forgetting happens).
Key Techniques: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs), Q-Learning, Whittle Index Heuristic, Network Modeling.
How it works (Intuition): The system learns which educational item recommendation gives the best long-term reward
(student knowledge), considering both the direct learning from the item and the indirect learning boost to related topics.

excel at generation, SR at interpretability, RL/Bandits at sequential decision-making.
Open Challenges and Future Directions
What’s missing? (Limitations):
• LLLM Teacher: Primarily model-model interaction; generalizing to real human students needs more work.
True effectiveness of personalization is still debated.
• Symbolic Diagnosis: Scalability of GP for very complex functions? Robustness across different domains?
• Adaptive Curriculum: Assumes observable knowledge states; cold-start problem (needs initial data);
network structure might be unknown.
Unresolved challenges:
• Holistic Student Modeling: Combining cognitive state (Shen, Tio) with interaction style/needs (Saha).
• Synergy: How to best combine these approaches
• Long-term Effects & Real-world Deployment: Most studies are limited in time/scope.
Why it matters? Bridging these gaps is crucial for creating truly effective and adaptive AI Education systems.
Future opportunities: Hybrid models, better human-AI collaboration frameworks in education, focus on
specific domains/skills.
Connecting Research to Practice: My AI
Tutor Project Prototype
Goal: Develop an accessible and personalized AI tutor using LLLMs to address limitations in tutoring availability.
Motivation: Inspired by the potential for personalization (LLM Teacher) and the need for adaptive curriculum
Approach:
• Leverage LLLMs for generating explanations and dialogue (similar to LLLM Teacher).
• Focus on domain-specific knowledge integration (loading specific educational materials) - in progress.
• Aim for student state adaptation (addressing a challenge related to all approaches).
• Utilize workflow automation (n8n) and APIs for practical implementation (telegram bot).
Current status: Working prototype is deployed (n8n, VPS, Docker, Telegram integration), exploring prompt
engineering strategies and ways to load specific educational materials. A working demo is available at
https://t.me/test_n8n_tg_bot (please note this is an active work-in-progress prototype and it may occasionally be
unavailable due to server updates).
