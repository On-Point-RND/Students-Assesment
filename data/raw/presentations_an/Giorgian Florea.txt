Conclusion
• As a prepossesing, a method of cropping an image of breast along
its border using U-net (trained in our own dataset) is proposed for:
+4.4% ROC- AUC
1. Removing artifacts;
+11.3% F1
2. Increasing the resolution of a breast tissues.
• The MamT4 model is demonstrated, a new architecture for classification
based on the Transformer Encoder block, which uses a feature vectors
from four studies mammogram.
