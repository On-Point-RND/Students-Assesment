If a spacecraft with a telescope is delivered there, it will be able to obtain images of the exoplanet with a resolution of up to 10 km/pixel.

Slide 3
----------------------------------------
THE PROBLEM OF SPACECRAFT CONTROL IN THE FIELD OF THE GRAVIITATIONAAL LENS OF THE SUN
The velocity of the device along the focal line is ~25 au/year (118 km/s)
The required control accuracy is of the order of 1 m
550 AU ≈ 3.2 light days => autonomy is required

It allows you to form control and navigation laws that are potentially resistant to various distuurbances and emergency situations.
It is expected that the resulting management will be able. to adapt. to variations of pre-plaNNed scenarios.

Slide 5
----------------------------------------
To develop and investigate algorithm for autonomous spacecraft control in the field of the Solar gravitational focus based on reinforcement learning methods.
THE PURPOSE OF THE WORK
The problem of spacecraft motion is considered in two formulations:
1) It is assumed that the focus axis is at rest, and only the jet acceleration from the engines acts on the device u:
2) The movement of the focus axis is taken into account, the equaations of motion are written in a non-inertial coordinate system, which causes non-inertial acceleations. a:

----------------------------------------
FCS (Focus Coordinate System) – the cooordinate system associated with the lens focus:
The origin of coordinates coincides with the Sun (moving relative to barycenteer)
The z-axis is directed along the focal line (rotatates due to the movement of the Sun and the exoplanet)

EQUATIONS OF MOTION

- radius is the vector of the spacecraft in the coordinate system of the focus
- the transition matrix from the inertial system to the focus coordinate system
- acceleation of the Sun's motion relative to the barycenteer of the solar system in the coordinate system of the focus
- control vector in the focus coordinate system

THE ARCHIITECCTURE OF THE RL ALGORIHTM AND THE REWARD FUNCTION
The control is consideered to be impulsed :
|∆v | ≤ ∆vmax
The purpose of the control is to bring the device as close as possible to the axis of focus with a minimum radial velocity (relative to the axis).
The number of pulses is 6,and the interval between pulses is 5 days.

CONCLUSION
13/13
Algorithm for autonomous spacecraft control in the area of the Sun's focus were obtained using reinforcement learning methods:
1) In a problem that did not take into account the movement of the focal axis, convergence was obtained: the final distances were small, regarldess of the initiaal conditions
2) It turned out that an agent trained in a model without non-inertial forces cannot cope with ensuring proper control in the presence of non-inertial forces
3) Training an agent in a model that takes into account the movement of the focal axis turned out to be a much more diffiicult task. Currreently, convergence in has not been achieved, but work is actively underway to achieve convergence
