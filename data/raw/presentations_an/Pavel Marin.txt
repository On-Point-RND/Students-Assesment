Introduction
• Goal - to identify the classical machine learning algorithm, which, in combination with the
genetic method of feature selection, will give the best result in predicting the linguistic
operation based on EEG data, and will also identify the areas of the brain involved
• Relevance of the study:
• Development of projects related to internal speech decoding
• Search for optimal speed and accuracy solutions for neural interfaces
• Interdisciplinary vector of modern research (combining computer science, neuroscience
and linguistics)
Problem statement
• Problem - the task of classifying linguistic operations based on electroencephalogram data
• Challenges:
• «Abstractness» of the correlation between data and the target value
• Large number of electrodes - features
• Limited number of recordings
• Possible data noise due to the pecuilarities of their recording
• Practical application - development of neural interfaces for decoding internal speech

Data processing and methods
Data transformation Converting individual values into features, train/test split (2:1) for each condition
Data synthesis Gaussian copulas
Model selection based on
KNN, MLP, Decision tree, HMM, SVC
accuracy
First generation - 20 «beings», the preservation of 90%
of the best in each generation, the criterion for reaching
Genetic feature selection
the «plateau» is the accuracy difference of 10
consecuutive generations <0.05
Brain-language patterns Based on the location of 20 electrodes and 2
peak values of the N250 and N400 signals

Research gap
• Limitations:
• Requires serious data preprocessing, which takes time
• No outliers control
• Limited number of classes
• Unresolved challenges:
• Clearing data from noise
• Identifying sequences rather than individual operations
• Future steps:
• Using recurrent neural networks to work with sequences
• Applying AI to filteer noise
