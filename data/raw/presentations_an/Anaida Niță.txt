Recommender systems have become increasingly popular for providing personalized recommendations to
users. Recent studies have shown that transformer-based approaches can enhance the performance of
these systems. However, these models usually consider the sequence of past user interactions and do not
take into account the time of prediction.

• Time context helps to improve quality of recommendations
• We have introduced a simple-yet-effective approach to incorporating time-context into
many next-item recommendations
• Our method has been shown to be effective on various datasets
