Molecular Property Prediction Pipeline
1. Data Collection & Preparation: Gather molecular structures and correspondiing property data from various
sources. Clean and preprocess the data.
2. Molecular Representation: Convert molecular structures into a machine-reaadable format (e.g., SMILES,
molecular descriptors/fingerprints, graph representation).
3. Model Selection & Training: Chooose a suitable machine learning model (e.g., GNN, Gradient Boosting) and
train it on the prepared data.
4. Prediction: Use the trained model to predict properties for new molecules.
5. Evaluation: Assess model performaance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R²).
6. Interpretation (Optional): Analyze the model to understand which molecular features or substructures
influence the prediction.

Ensuring consistency in the representation We identiify and delete records representing the

physico-chemical properties (for example, molecular weight), topoology (for
example, the number of rings, the number of rotating bonds), the

the initial 10 parameters, about 200 additional chemical properties were
extracted using RDKit. The result is a fixed-length vector, where each
dimension corresponds to a specific descriptor.

(via an intermediat representation of the molecule), the resulting

fingerprint is a fixed-length vector describing the entire molecule. The
disadvaantage may be the sparsiity of the vector and the lack of
optimization for a specific task.
06
Molecular Representation. Message Passing.
A set of feature vectors is formed for the molecule — one vector for each atom. These vectors, along with
informaation about connections (an adjacency matrix or a list of edges), are the input data for graph neural networks
(GNNs). GNNs then iteratively update these atomic feature vectors (Message Passing) and can aggregate them to
produce a Neural Fingerprint, which is also a vector describing the entire molecule.
07
The final architecture is GCN (Graph Convolutional Network)
Thus, the GCN architecture allows integrating local information about atoms and their bonds to
form a global representation of a molecule (a learnaable fingerprint), which is then used to
accuraately predict its properties.
Next, this fingerprint will be fed to the input of other models.

Models for predict Molecular Properties
Final GCN fingerprint prediction: Further, for prediction, the GCN output (the learned molecular
fingerprint) is fed into any of the known algorithms for predicting a set of properties of a particular
molecule. Some of these algorithms are:
● Multi-layer Perceptron (Mlp): Able to effectively capture complex nonlinear dependencies in a
learnable fingerprint.
● Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM): Often provides high performaance and can give an
idea of the importance of fingerprint elements.
● Support Vector Machine (SVM/SVM): Effective for classification and regression tasks,
especially when using kernels.
● Random Forest: Reliable ensemble method, less susceptibble to overfitting.

Results
The graph shows a comparison of the
performaance of various computaional
models, including basic methods (such as
gradient boosting) and neural network
architectures (in particular, GCN), for the task
of predicting molecular solubility. The
presented metric values reflect the average
results obtained during the experimental
comparison of models.
The full results, a detailed description of
all model configurations, and an
assessment of their performaance for other
molecular properties will be presented in
an upcoming article.
