Problem statement
• Sensor calibration is the search for the best transform of sensor data into the
parameters of the satellite’s orientation relative to the Sun
• Required average accuracy of the calibration algorithm – at least 1°
• Algorithm must work stably within the entire field of view of the sensor
• It is required to ensure the absence of blind spots within the satellite perimeter
• The algorithm must provide the optimal number of calibration characteristics,
and the orientation algorithm based on it should be optimal in time and memory
Overview of Existing Solutions
This problem is quite popular in space industry, however:
• In most cases [name] [surname] work is underway with sensor based on CMOS/CCD matrices
• This work introduce alternative measurement model that simplifies calibration
algorithms. Conventional measurement model works with raw ADC outputs of light
intensities [4][5]
• There is no comparative analysis of calibration algorithms within a single scientific
paper
• Although traditional calibration methods perform well, modern ML techniques
researched to explore their potential in solving this kind of problem

Calibration Algorithm Synthesis. Linear Operator
• Due to data linearities it can be assumed that the desired
transformation is a linear operator
• Adding some offset to it, we get:
𝑋 𝑥 + 𝑥
= 𝐴−1 ∙ 𝑐 ,𝐴−1 ∈ ℝ2×2
𝑌 𝑦 + 𝑦
𝑐
• Thus, the calibration characteristics are 4 numbers from
the matrix 𝐴−1 and 2 linear offsets. These parameters
found using the least squares method
• Advantages:
▪ Only 6 calibration characteristics
▪ Simple computing for orientation algorithm
• Disadvantages:
▪ Significant performance decrease when non-
linearities occur

• Disadvantages:
▪ Difficult to interpret for inference on an MCU
Multi-layer perceptron – basic artificial neural network algorithm
that can approximate non-linear functions with high flexibility
• Input data scaling was performed as preprocessing procedure to
improve performance
• Each of the output coordinate has its own regression model:
𝑋 = 𝑀𝐿𝑃 𝑥,𝑦
𝑌 = 𝑀𝐿𝑃(𝑥,𝑦)
• Advantages:
▪ Adaptable to subtle distortions In the sensor’s field of view
▪ Can learn any smooth function unlike low-degree
polynomial
• Disadvantages:
▪ Risk of over fitting
▪ Difficult to interpret for inference on an MCU

Polynomial regression and multi-layer perceptron have shown better efficiency that other algorithms observed. Main
disadvantage of MLP – interpretability for bare-metal architecture. It requires a lot of labor to make it work on MCU orientation module
Conclusion

possibilities. Defective sensors have been eliminated
• A new calibration algorithm was synthesized based on the selected measurement model and
the assumption of linearity of calibration data
• The previously known sensor calibration algorithm were adapted to the new measurement
model and implemented
• Few advanced machine learning techniques were used to compare their efficiency to traditional
calibration algorithm
• Comparative analysis was carried out to determine the most effective calibration method
