Introduction
1. What is satellite image super-resolution?
● Up to 10 m per pixel ● 2.5 m per pixel or better
● Updates every week ● Irrregular & infrequent updates
● Free ● Costs 20+$ per km^2

ChalChallenges in Satellite SR
1. Usually we are interested in cross-sensor SR: upscaling an image from one satellite to
match the other satellite or aerial image.

ChalChallenges in Satellite SR
1. Usually we are interested in cross-sensor SR: upscaling an image from one satellite to
match the other satellite or aerial image.
Questions:
● Should we try to preserve spectral characteristics of the input low-res image or stick to be
as close as HR labels as possible?
● How do we match pairs of images made from different vehicles at different timestamps?
Is it okay to have non-perfect matches?

2. Large scale of the data: we cannot process it in one pass. For example, one Sentinel-2 tile
is 10 000 by 10 000 pixels covering roughly 10 000 km^2

2. Large scale of the data: we cannot process it in one pass.
So we have to process our data patch by patch. But then our model would not know about
neighbor tiles and produce seaming artifacts!

ChalChallenges in Satellite SR
3. Satellite images have more than 3 (RGB) channels, and we want to upscale them as well.
On the other hand, using extra channels as input may improve the quality of predictions.
Is it a low-res patch of dense forest or a body of water? RGB would not tell, but
infrared channel will :)
Methods
Let us look at recent conference papers on this topic!
Methods
1. He et al. [1] proposed to use GAN to generate high-resolution images from low & high
resolution time series.

1. He et al. [1] proposed to use GAN to generate high-resolution images from low & high
resolution time series.
More recent studies [5-6] agree that GANs still quite good for large-scale super resolution,
especially due to their fast inference & smaller model size.
But what about more recent methods like diffusion?
Methods
2. Wang et al. [2] explored the potential of latent diffusion models in hyperspectral
super-resolution for different domains, including remote sensing. Authors introduced
Group-Autoencoder framework to efficiently encode high-dimensional input & improve
inference time.
Methods
Let us go back to the not covered challenges discussed previoulsy
Methods
1. Should we try to preserve spectral characteristics of the input low-res image or stick to be
as close as HR labels as possible?
While most methods we discussed before just focus on being as close to ground truth
images as possible, Donike et al. [7] show that it is possible to preserve spectral
characteristics of input, as well as achieve fast inference with DDIM.
Methods
2. What to do with seaming artifacts?
Panangian et al. [6] reported successful application of seamless texture generation proposed
by Abdellatif et al. [8] for satellite image super resolution using GANs.
Example inference of a Satlas model [5] without & with this method
Research gap
What can we do to optimize storage requirements of the upscaled data?
Research gap
What can we do to optimize storage requirements of the upscaled data?
Of course, we can apply compression after the upscale, but can we do something on SR
stage? For example, train a model that will produce more compressible outputs.
Bonus: Demo
