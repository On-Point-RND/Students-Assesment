Research Question
What are the key factors influencing
electricity consumption across different
regions of the Russian Federation?
Project Tech Stack
• Python: For parsing additional data, cleaning data, designing
machine learning models, feature importance analysis (SHAP), and
visualization (matplotlib);
• Yandex Datalense: For data visualization when generating
descriptive statistics;
• R: For building econometric models. (In progress...)

Comparison by regions
Summary of Key Patterns in All Regions
(Russia):
1.Electricity prices show low sensitivity to volume,
typically ranging 500–2,000 RUB/Mwh.
2.Nighttime consumption (10 PM–6 AM) is
significantly lower, with the lowest demand at ~3
AM.
3.Winter demand is 1.2–1.5× higher than summer.
4.Colder temperatures directly increase
consumption.
