Introduction
topic
• What is the ?
CNN-based semantic segmentation in biomedical imaging, with a focus on polyp
detection in endoscopic images
.
• Why is it important?
Accurate segmentation is crucial for early diagnosis (e.g., colorectal cancer).
Manual annotation is slow and inconsistent — automation helps improve both speed
and accuracy.
Biomedical data is noisy, variable, and often limited → specialized models are needed.
• Goal of the review
Compare CNN-based architectures for biomedical segmentation.
Analyze strengths/weaknesses in context of polyp segmentation.
Identify trends, limitations, and possible directions (e.g., diffusion, multimodal, etc.).
Problem statement
•Polyp segmentation is crucial for early colorectal cancer detection
•Manual annotation is:
• Time-consuming
• Inconsistent
• Hard to scale
•High-quality annotated datasets are limited, especially in medical domains
•Polyps vary in size, shape, texture, and lighting → segmentation is challenging
•Traditional CV methods struggle with low contrast, occlusion, and noisy
backgrounds
•Need for CNN-based models that:
• Are robust to visual variability
• Perform well with limited supervision
• Maintain high precision in real-world clinical use
Methods
•Encoder–decoder architecture
•Lightweight convolutional blocks
•Residual connections
•Skip connections (feature reuse)
•Nearest-neighbor upsampling
(artifact-free)
Methods
• Data & preprocessing

Research gap
• What’s missing? Identify limitations in current approaches.
• Performance drops in low-quality or occluded images
• Models are often data-hungry → struggle with small, annotated biomedical datasets
• Unresolved challenges: Mention problems that still exist.
Lack of standardized benchmarks across real-world clinical settings
• Why it matters? Explain how filling these gaps could improve real-world use.
• Better generalization = more reliable diagnostics
• Interpretability = higher clinical adoption and trust
• Data-efficient models = easier deployment in low-resource settings
• Future opportunities: Suggest next steps.
• Leveraging diffusion models for synthetic data generation
• Exploring multimodal learning (e.g., combining endoscopy images + text reports)
