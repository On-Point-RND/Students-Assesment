1. Introduction
Why: Addressing the mobility challenges faced by impaired individuals at pedestrian crossings.
Current Challenges:
1. Traffic systems prioritize vehicles, neglecting physically impaired pedestrians.
2. Longer waiting times, safety risks, and lack of real-time adaptability.
Research Gap:
Existing IoT-based systems ignore or put less consideration on physically impaired pedestrians using mobility aids (wheelchairs, crutches).

2. Proposed System (IITMS)
Three Core Modules:
Detection: YOLOv9 model identifies mobility aids (94.6% mAP@0.5).
Communication: V2X enables vehicle-infrastructure-pedestrian coordination.
Action Selection: A gradient-based algorithm optimizes traffic signals.
