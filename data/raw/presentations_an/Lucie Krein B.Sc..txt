Generative Molecular Design for Medicinal Chemistry Using AI Platform FREED++


Slide 2
----------------------------------------
Introduction

In June 2023, [compaany]'s drug INS018_055, designed to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, became the first drug entirely discovered and designed by AI to reach phase 2 clinical trials.
The company also has two other drugs in clinical trials that were partially created using AI:
For the treatment of CCOVID-19
For the treatment of solid tumors

Drug discovery

Classical approach
7-10 years

Using AI
from 18 months

Drug
Our goal is to develop an AI-driven platform to generate novel drug candidates optimized for therapeutic efficacy, intellectual property potential, and manufacturability.

----------------------------------------
Problem statement

Traditional drug discovery is time-consuming and inefficient. Existing AI models often neglect patentability and synthesizability.
Our Solution: A generative AI model (FREED++) that simultaneously optimizes:
 Activity: Molecular docking (AutoDock Vina) + ML-based pharmacophore analysis.
 Patentability: Patent database screening (collaboration with [compaany]).
 Synthesizability: Retrosynthetic accessibility prediction.

Focus on ERα antagonists for hormone-dependent cancers.


Slide 4
----------------------------------------
Methods

Generative Architecture: Modified FREED++ (Neural Optimal Transport-based framework).
Data Integration: ChemDiv (1.3M compounds), Enamine (200k), proprietary patent data.
Preprocessing: SMILES canonicalization, deduplication, RDKit fingerprinting, batch processing.
Why FREED++?
Proven success: Won the Neftekod Hackathon by adapting FREED++ for antioxidant prediction.
Flexibility: Combines molecular docking, ML, and patent analysis in one pipeline.


Slide 5
----------------------------------------
Results

Generated 1,000 novel molecules, with Top-10 ranked by QED (drug-likeness) and DockingScore.
Zero overlap with PubChem (Top-100 molecules), ensuring patentability.
Molecules sent to [compaany] for experimental testing.
Metrics:
QED: Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness.
DockingScore: Binding affinity to ERα (PDB: 1ERE).


Slide 6
----------------------------------------
Research gap

Current Limitations:
Limited integration of ADME/Tox data (e.g., CYP450 inhibition, hERG cardiotoxicity).
Scalability issues with large datasets (>1.5M molecules).
Future Opportunity is to implement multimodal AI (diffusion models + LLLMs) for enhanced generative accuracy.
