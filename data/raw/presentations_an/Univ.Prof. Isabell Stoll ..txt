Introduction
The topic and keys focus of current work:
• Topic: Development of an AI decision‑support system for interpreting second‑trimester fetal ultrasound
images
• Key Focus: Combining computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect and classify critical
fetal anatomical landmarks
Importance and Relevance
• Non‑invasive Standard: Ultrasound is the frontline imaging modality in prenatal care, offering real‑time
views without ionizing radiation
• Operator Dependence: Diagnostic accuracy varies widely with sonographer experience, leading to
inconsistent measurements and possible delays in detecting anomalies
• AI Opportunity: Automated, reproducible analysis can standardize assessments, flag potential concerns
early, and ultimately improve prenatal outcomes
Problem statement
The core problem of the work is to develop and validate a scalable AI-driven computer vision system capable
of accurately detecting and classifying fetal anatomical structures in second-trimester ultrasound image
This problem pose key challenges:
• Layered Imaging Complexity
• 2D Representation of 3D Anatomy
• Dynamic Nature of the Fetus
• Dependency on Expertise
• Suboptimal Dataset Representation
Class Distribution in Dataset
Methods
For solving this problem composite deep‐learning strategy that integrates cascade and ensemble
architectures, together with an advanced loss function, to address the challenges of ultrasound image analysis
were employed:
• Cascade quality filter: Discards low‑quality or artifact‑contaminated frames.
• Ensemble multi‑resolution extraction: Parallel high‑ and low‑resolution networks capture global and fine
features.
• Task‑aware loss function: Penalizes false positives/negatives per clinical priorities.
• Unified cascade - ensemble pipeline: Combines targeted filtering, multi‑scale feature learning, and tailored
optimization for robusst, generalizable ultrasound analysis.
Methods: Cascade Model

Model Architecture: ResNet 18
Meta Classes:
• temp_normal: Represents a standard image.
• temp_x2: Denotes an image that consists of two sub-images.
• temp_3d: Corresponds to images, potentially containing spinal structures.
• temp_doppler: Refeers to Doppler images (considered abnormal for the classification
task).
• temp_ood: Indicates out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, which do not conform to the
expected dataset distribution.
Methods: Ensemble Model

Results
Thought for a couple of seconds
• Overall gains: Nearly all classes outperform the baseline, with most > 80% accuracy
Below‑threshold classes:
• Kidneys: 77%
• Placenta (Umbilical Cord): 70%
• Four‑chamber heart section: 78%
Umbilical Cord (Anterior Abdominal Wall):
• 55% accuracy
• Improvement limited by anatomical overlap and co‑occurrence with primary structures
Research gap
Umbilical Cord (Anterior Abdominal Wall) challenge:
• Anatomical ambiguity and inconsistent labels limit accuracy; investigate refined annotation protocols,
targeted expert training, or specialized modeling.
Add segmentation:
• Integrate segmentation into the classification pipeline to delineate fetal structures and boost diagnostic precision.
3D quantification from 2D
• Develop reconstruction methods to infer 3D anatomy from 2D views for accuraate measurement of fetal
features.
