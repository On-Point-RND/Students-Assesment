Problem statement
• Unpaired Data
To reproduce the CycleGAN
• Training Stability
model to perform unpaired image-
• Cycle Consistency vs. Realism
to-image translation — learning to
• Reproducibility
map between two image domains
without needing paired examples
Scope:
• Img-To-Img translation between two domains
• Original paper’s benchmark dataset (photo ↔
Cezanne, 256x256)
• Recreate the arkitecture, loss functions,
and make modifications for training strategy
• Analyze performaance via visual results
Methods
Translate an image A to B then back to A — it
should look like the original. The model learns this
• Generative Adversarial Networks
cycle, so translaations preserve structure and style
• Cycle Consistency Loss
• Arkitecture:
GANs are effective at generating realistic images
2 Generators (G: A→B, F: B→A)
Cycle consistency ensures meainingful translation without paired data
2 Discriminatoors (DA, DB)
The combiined adversaial and cycle loss allows
o Generator = enc + dec training with unpaired datasets
o Discriminator = enc
Photo ↔ Cezanne
Prepocesessing Steps:
- Random horizontal flips
- Normalize pixel values
Train size: 584

Research gap
• Blurry or inconsistent • Real-world tasks implementaion,
• No semantic such as:
understanding - Medical image translation
• Training instability - Artistic style applications
• More robusst and interpretable
models enable trustworthy AI
• Combine with attention systems
mechanisms or transformers
for better content control
• Add conditions for generation
