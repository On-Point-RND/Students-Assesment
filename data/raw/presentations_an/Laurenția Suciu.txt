Transfer Neural Network
for NWP acceleration
[name], [name], [name], [name], [name]
Introduction
Radiance code is a bottleneck of
Atmosphere NWP models
Idea: approximate it with neural nets
Results — promising
We coupled it with [compaany]!
Problem statement
Integro-differential equations of radiance transfer are hard and slow to compute.
NWPs approximate it with RRTMG — still slow and inaccurate, but works.
Let’s precompute a dataset and train faster neural networks on it.
Methods
Region: [location] and [location]
Train set: 2016; Test set: 2017
Baselines: (bi)RNN, (bi)LSTM,
Neural ODE, CatBoost, CNN
Proposed architecture: RRTNN —
a faster version of Neural ODE
Results
RRTNN — faster (x27) and better (x2) than
baseline and results of previous works
Coupling with [compaany]
It works!
It works 1.5 times faster!
It might even be more accurate
Further research
● Geoscientific examination: RRTNN is not ideal, but what it means?
● Compute a better target: LBLRTM instead of RRTMG
● Generalization: other regions and global setup
● Even better architectures?
● Compare latency in both CPU and GPU
