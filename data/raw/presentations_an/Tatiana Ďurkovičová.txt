Introduction
● The following presentation is based on the article “Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Networks for solving Navier-Stokes equations”, which I co-authored. Whilst it’s undergoing a peer-review process, it’s publicly available as arXiv:2504.01891
The key point of this research is to establish the possibility of the small hybrid quantum machine learning algorithms application in the field of the physical simulations.
- Neural Networks are promising framework in the field of physical modeling [1, 2], as they can help to mitigate the known limits of the classical numerical solvers, such as necessity for the reset of a simulation due to a small change in the parameters
- Quantum Machine Learning provides a possibilities to build smaller, yet more expressive numerical models [3, 4, 5], due to such quantum effects as superposition and entanglement

Parallel Hybrid Network (PHN) is a quantum model, which is implemented separately on 2-qubit simulator, with states corresponding to x-coordinate and y-coordinate respectively
Methods
As a test for the proposed models, a special 2d hydrodynamic problem, called Kovasznay flow, is chosen.
The test is performed on the uniform grid of n = 5000 points (both inside the region and on its boundary) in rectangular domain: Fig, 2
Analytical solutions of Kovasznay flow, normalized respectively to Reynolds number.
* - It’s a widely used framework to assess numerical simulation methods in the field, as Kovasznay flow is one of the few known analytical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations
Results
For data-driven training, Hybrid Multi-Stream Physics Network was able to accurately reproduce the Kovasznay flow (Fig. 3). Its fully-classical analog, while having more trainable parameters, performed worse.

Future Research
● Achieved results of Hybrid Multi-Stream Physics models are limited by the criteria set due to the current quantum devices development, as we are living in so-called NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) era, when even the number of available qubits usually limited.
○ Thus, It would be beneficial for future usage, to investigate the scalability of the proposed models with the increased dimensionality.
● From the ML perspective, future research should include the work on the credibility intervals in respect to the scalable hyperparameters, such as Reynolds number in the Image was generated by DALL-E model
