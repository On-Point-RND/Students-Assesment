Data Preprocessing & Dual-
View Features
Model Training - Part 1: Contrastive
Pretraining (CLP)
Model: Stgram-MFN (CNN + Transformer + Gram) -> Local +
Global Features
Stage 1
• CLP (Contrastive Learning Pretraining)
Input
• Dual View Features (A and B)
Goal
•Pull embeddings A & B (same sound) together;
Push apart embeddings from different sounds.
Loss
• Contrastive Loss (InfoNCE)
Result
• Robust, invariant embeddings of
normality
Model Training - Part 2: Self-Controlled
Fine-tuning (SCF)
•Initialization: Weights from
CLP
•Input: Single feature view
•Goal: Adapt features to THIS
machine + Increase normal
cluster compactness
•Method: Train on machine
classification task (Loss:
CrossEntropy)
•Result: Embeddings specific
to THIS machine's normal
operation.
