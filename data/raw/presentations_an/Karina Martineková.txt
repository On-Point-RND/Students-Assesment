Results
The results of averaged 5 runs
show that Euclidean
regularization shows the worst
results, while regularization
with the metric on the Poincaré
disk performs about the same
as the baseline, losing to
embeddings based on
hyperbolic distances from the
geopt library.
Future research should focus
on refining hyperbolic
parameter tuning to ensure the
expected benefiits of hyperbolic
geometry in recommendation
systems
