Integrated Multi-stage Algorithm for Personalized Skincare Product Recommendactions



Slide 2
----------------------------------------
Introduction

What is the topic?
A multimodal AI framework combining skin images, ingredient analysis, and genetic data to recommend personalized skincare products.

Why is it important?
Current methods rely on single data sources (e.g., images or self-reports), leading to biased/incomplete recommendations.
Personalized skincare improves outcomes by addressing genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors.

Background
Skin health is influenced by genetics (e.g., eczema risk), environment (pollution), and lifestyle (skincare habits).
Existing AI tools focus on single tasks (e.g., acne detection) but lack holistic integration.

Goal
Develop a unified system to:
Classify skin type/conditions.
Analyze ingredient compatibility.
Assess genetic risks.
Combine all three for precise recommendations.



Slide 3
----------------------------------------
Problem statement

What are we solving?
Unimodal approaches ignore critical data (e.g., genetics), leading to suboptimal recommendations. Therefore, this approach is a multimodal AI framework that combines skin images, ingredient analysis, and genetic data to recommend personalized skincare products.



Challenges
Integrating diverse data types (images, text, genetics).
Ensuring accuracy across modalities.
Addressing dataset biases (e.g., limited skin tone diversity).

Scope
Focus on combining the three modules:
CNN for skin images.
BERT for ingredient text.
Logistic regression for genetic risk.

Results

Fig. 5. Training vs. Validation Loss And Performance Metrics over epochs
Fig. 2. Skin type classification performance curves
Performance: Validation accuracy rises from 35.7% to 100% by epoch 23.
Key Insight: Model achieves perfect classification with stable validation loss (~0.6), indicating no overfitting.

Why It Matters: High accuracy (95% AUC-ROC) ensures reliable skin type detection across diverse users.

Loss Trends: Training loss drops sharply (1.75 → 0.028), while validation loss stabilizes at 0.599.

Metrics: F1-score stabilizes at 87.4%, balancing precision (87%) and recall (87%).

Takeaway: Model generalizes well with minimal gap between training/validation performance.

Results

Fig. 3. Risk Score Histogram vs SNP Correlation heatmap

Histogram: Genetic risk scores follow a normal distribution, with 82% correlation to dermatologist evaluations.

Heatmap: Strong SNP-cluster correlations (>0.7) link specific genetic markers to conditions like eczema.

Key Insight: Genetic data stratifies users into risk tiers, enabling proactive recommendations.

Bar Chart: Top ingredients (e.g., hyaluronic acid) appear in >75% of effective products.

t-SNE Plot: Ingredients cluster by function (moisturizers, actives, preservatives), guiding balanced formulations.

Why It Matters: Clusters help avoid incompatible combinations (e.g., harsh actives for sensitive skin).



Slide 8
----------------------------------------
Results

What It Shows: Integration of skin, ingredient, and genetic modules into a unified recommendation engine.

Key Insight: Combines strengths of CNN (images), BERT (text), and logistic regression (genetics) for 91.5% overall accuracy.

Why It Matters: Outperforms single-modality systems (e.g., image-only models ignore genetics).

Example: A user with dry skin (CNN), genetic psoriasis risk (logistic regression), and incompatible ingredients (BERT) receives a tailored, safer product.

Metrics					Key Findings
Precision: 87% (minimizes false positives). 	91.5% accuracy in skin type/condition classification.
Recall: 87% (captures true positives). 	95% AUC-ROC for skin disease detection.
F1-Score: 87.4% (balanced performance). 	82% correlation between genetic risk scores and dermatologist evaluations.



Slide 9
----------------------------------------
Research gap
Limitations
Dataset lacks diversity in skin tones/genetic markers.
No real-time adaptation to new skincare products.

Unresolved Challenges
Integrating dynamic data (e.g., microbiome changes).
Ethical concerns around genetic data privacy.

Why It Matters
Filling gaps improves fairness and real-world applicability.

Future Opportunities
Expand datasets with global populations.
Partner with dermatologists for clinical validation.
