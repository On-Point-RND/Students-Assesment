Introduction
HD-map - a highly accurate digital
representation of the road environment,
typically consisting of lane-level geometric
information and associated semantic
objects/features such as traffic lights,
signals, and crosswalks
Also, HD maps also include a graph
reflecting the topology of the road, which
helps in making traffic planning decisions. Just illustrate what typical HD-map looks like
Problem statement
We want to construct an HD vector map M that best fits the observed sensor data D, while
satisfying certain constraints and minimizing reconstruction errors.
In other words if Θ represents the set of parameters defining M, we want to find optimal
map parameters Θ∗, that minimizes the cost function J(Θ):
Θ∗=argminJ(Θ)
Θ
J(Θ)=ω ⋅E (Θ)+ω ⋅E (Θ)+ω ⋅E (Θ)+ω ⋅R(Θ)

Problem statement
Challenges:
● Fusing heterogeneous multimodal data
● Real-Time Processing
● Accuracy and Robustness
Scope:
● Multimodal AI methods for online HD-map reconstruction, emphasizing
integration of LIDAR, camera, and temporal data
Background ● Metrics
● ChamferDistance(CD):Measures
spatial similarity between two shapes by
calculating the average nearest-point
distance between their points sets.
● Intersection-over-Union(IoU/mIoU):
Evaluate overlap between predicted and
ground-truth map elements, often
averaged(mIoU) for multiple categories.
● Mean Average Precision(mAP):
Assesses detection accuracy using
precision and recall, adapted for map
elements with CD-based thresholds.

Research gap ● Limitations
Key Limitations Why it matters?
● Uncertainty Estimation: Most
methods lack confidence measures
for reconstructed map entities.
● Map Reliability: Confidence in map
accuracy is critical for safe
autonomous navigation.
● Task Integration: Limited connection
with downstream (e.g., path planning)
and upstream (e.g., perception)
tasks.
● Task Integration: Tight connection
with other AV modules enhances
overall performance.
● Predictive Mapping: Inability to
anticipate future or occluded
environments beyond current
observations.
● Predictive Mapping: Using unseen environments is key to
achieving higher autonomy levels.
Research gap ● Opportunities
● Predictive Mapping: Develop methods to predict future or occluded map
elements directly from real-time sensor observations, reducing reliance on
pre-existing map data. (with recent approaches of SD-to-HD map generation)
● Task Integration: Focus on conceptually aligned integration of HD-map
reconstruction with perception and planning, prioritizing compatible
architectures for efficient system performance.
● Map Reliability: Investigate techniques to quantify uncertainty in
reconstructed HD-maps, enabling confidence-aware decision-making for safer
navigation.
