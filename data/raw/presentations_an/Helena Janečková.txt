Introduction
• What is the topic?
Teaching quadrupedal robots to mount skateboards autonomously using RL
• Why is it important?
Leonardo skateboarding demonstration
Robots can already ride [1, 2], but initial mounting phase remains an unsolved challenge in robotics
• Goal of the review
Demonstrate a novel approach for enabling robots to autonomously mount a skateboard using Reverse Curriculum Learning [https://umich-curly.github.io/DHAL/](https://umich-curly.github.io/DHAL/)

Problem statement
Train a quadruped robot to approach and mount a skateboard
Task scheme
Methods
Algorithm: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Reverse Curriculum Learning
NETWORK ARCHITECTURE AND TRAINING HYPER-PARAMETERS
Initialization: Custom Observations: Default Observations:
● Robot spawns randomly in vicinity of skateboard: robot: skate_pos_rel (m) of robot base
randomize_reset_base ● Relative orientation of skateboard: skate_rot_rel (rad)
● Random joint initialization: randomize_reset_joints
● Contacts between feet and skateboard (bool : 1/0)
Positive Rewards: Action Space Termination:
● Number of end effectors in contact with skateboard surface
Position control for all robot joints
Robot falling
● Velocity command tracking (directed to the skateboard)
● clamp( 15 * (Number of end effectors in contact - 3, [0,10])
Training stages:
1. Robot positioned directly above fixed skateboard
2. Random starting positions near skateboard
3. Adjacent starting positions with established gait
4. Testing with unfixed, mobile skateboard
Scene Elements:
● Unitree A1 Robot
● Skateboard
● Flat Terrain
Parallel training process

Research gap
Current limitations:
● Separate controllers for mounting and riding
● Limited testing in simulation environment
Mounting process
Future opportunities:
● Combine mounting and riding skills in one controller
● Real-world validation with physical robots
● Skateboard steering control via body leaning (NN path planning via Bézier curve)
