Background
Reinforcement learning is a method of machine learning in which an agent learns by interacting with an environment.
Q-learning – the agent optimizes the quality function with respect to the state-action parameter pair: Q(s, a).
In the DQN (Deep Q Network) algorithm, the Q-function is parameterized using an ANN with weights θ: Q(s, a, θ).
Features of DQN:
Buffer for storing past experience
Epsilon-greedy algorithm
Separate target network for estimating target values
Reward

Methods
Algorithm:
DQN for RL
Technical:
Python, OpenaI Gym, JupiterNotebook
NN module created from scratch – allowed to change NN topology in any way during training process
Created algorithm intuition:
1) A few neural nets of a basic topology are training to perform in an environment
2) After a given number of epochs performance is measured for each NN
3) If performance is good enough, we have found solution
If not, we change topologies of the networks and train them again, using pretrained weights. Repeat from 1.

Overview:
Using proposed algorithm the weights are learning in a more steady manner
Proposed algorithm showed a higher chance of finding a suitable topology, compared to simple enumeration algorithm
