Motivation – Microseismic Event Monitoring
When did the microseismic event
•
occur?
Where did the microseismic event
•
occur?
How big was the microseismic
•
event?
Challenges:
•
low signal-to-noise ratio
-
limited sensor coverage

Eikonal Equation
The eikonal equation is a first-order, non-linear partial differential equation

Methodology – Operator Learning
Operators are mathematical entities that perform transformations or mappings
➢
between input and output spaces:
• e.g. integration or differentiation
• Operator learning is continuous ( Not discrete, like Conventional NN )
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is a NN that learns to represent the solution operator of
➢
a PDE
Methodology – Fourier Neural Operators
FNOs are composed of two parts: a Fourier layer and a neural network
➢
Fourier layer decomposes the input function into its constituent frequencies
➢
Neural network then learns how to transform these frequencies into the
➢
desired output function

Methodology – FNO Localization. Model Training
All the trainings are done with a single GPU A5000 24GB

Dataset – [location] FORGE Site
FORGE project began in 2015
❖
250 km south of [location] and 16 km
❖
north of [location] (popu. 1400)
The site is unpopulated and covers ~5 km2
❖
Purpose is to bring EGS to commercial
❖
viability and visibility
EGS involves creation of a fracture network
❖
in hot, low-permeability rock so that water
can be circulated through the rock,
sweeping out the heat for power generation.

Dataset – [location] FORGE Site
7 wells drilled:
❖
58-32, a deep vertical well,
-
16A(78)-32 (injection) and 16B(78)-32 (production)
-
– two highly deviated deep wells,
68-32, 78-32, 78-32B, and 56-32 which are deep
-
seismic monitoring wells.
Stimulation tests and fracture modeling have been
❖
accomplished on 58-32 and 16A(78)-32
Seismicity has been monitored throughout the
❖
drilling and testing programs
All data are free and publicly available and stored
❖
on the Geothermal Data Repository

Potential – Why Real-Time Microseismic Monitoring?
✓ Hazard mitigation: ✓ Engineering goals:
▪ fault activation ▪ stimulated volume
▪ max magnitude during/after injection ▪ HF stage spacing
▪ reservoir integrity ▪ fault interaction
▪ proppaant placement
▪ stress inversion, etc.
Real-time analysis is key to both optimization of the controlled injection
➢
process and avoidance of rare but possible disasters.

Potential – Traffic Light System
• Traffic Light System (TLS) is a
method that was developed for
seismic monitoring to manage the
operations ( [surname] et al., 2017)
• Success of TLS relies on real-time capabilities in detecting and locating
microseismic events

Conclusions
1. Developed an FNO-based framework for accurate microseismic event localization.
2. Demonstrated robustness against noisy data and limited sensor coverage.
3. Validated using synthetic velocity models (Gradient and Marmousi) and real [location]
FORGE dataset.
4. Enables real-time localization without retraining, suitable for operational decision-
making.
5. Effective for enhancing safety and optimization in geothermal, hydraulic fracturing, and
carbon sequestration applications.
6. Future work to extend methodology to comprehensive 3D localization tasks.
