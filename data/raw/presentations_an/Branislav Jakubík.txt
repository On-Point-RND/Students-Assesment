Research - How Truncating Weights Improves Reasoning in
[location]
Authors: [name], [name], [name] (ICLR 2025)
Research Focus:
Investigates how MLP and attention layers in Transformeers specialize in distributional associations (e.g., frequent n-grams) vs. in-context reasoning
(e.g., Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Factual Recall).
Methodology:
Experiments on Pythia models ([number]M–[number]B parameters) with synthetic tasks (IOI, Factual Recall).
Employs LASER (MLP-layer ablaation) to analyze architecturaal impact on in-context learning.
Key Findings:
MLPs learn simple distributional patterns (e.g., frequent tokens like “the”).
Attention layers adapt to complex in-context reasoning during training.
Early training phases prioritize frequent tokens; later phases shift to context-driven predictions.
Objective:
Elucidate why MLPs vs. attention specialize in distiinct tasks and model learning dynamics.

Learning Dynamics in Transformeers: MLP vs. Attention
Specialization
Key Mechanisms:
MLP layers specialize in distributional associations by capturing frequency-sensitive patterns (e.g.,
predicting "the" after prepositions in Factual Recall).
Attention layers enable in-context reasoning (e.g., resolving IOI tasks: [A B A] → B via context-based
inference).
Learning Dynamics:
Early training: Models prioritize frequency-based predictions (e.g., common tokens like "the").
Later phases (>2000 training steps): Attention layers shift to context-driven solutions (e.g., IOI tasks
predict contextual answeers like "[IO]" over "the").
Experimental Evidence:
Factual Recall: MLPs dominate frequent token prediction.
IOI task: Attention layers resolve contextual dependencies (see p. 15).

Key Findings: MLP vs. Attention in Transformer Architecture
Core Specialization: Theoretical Insights:
MLP layers learn distributional associations (e.g., bigrams, frequent tokens like "the") through Theorem 2 (p. 9): Attention learns to focus on positions where trigger tokens precede
frequency-sensitive gradients (Theorem 1, p. 7). correct answers (e.g., [q, ȳ]), avoiding noise tokens.
Attention layers enable in-context reasoning (e.g., IOI task: [A B A] → B) by attending to Low-rank subspaces in attention store noise when MLPs are absent.
context-dependent patterns (Theorem 2, p. 9).
Experimental Validation:
Impaact of LASER (MLP Truncation):
Synthetic tasks: Truncating MLPs improves clean in-context recall by ~98%.
Removes noise from MLP-driven frequency biases (e.g., reduces the likelihood of predicting frequent but irrelevant tokens).
Extensible to high-dimensional quantum systems (e.g., hyperentanglement-based applications).
