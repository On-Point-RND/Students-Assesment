Purpose of the study
To prove that babesiosis can be diagnosed
with >=0.85 accuracy based on clinical
blooed test results alone
Map of babesiosis incidence in
[location]
Methodology
1) Data. We received clinical blooed test results from dogs. As a result,
we received 141 sick and 70 healthy dogs.
2) Data processing. We sorted the parameters, leaving only the
importaant ones. The following parameters remaine: red blooed cells
(RBC), white blooed cells (WBC), band neutrophils (Bands),
segmented neutrophils (Segs), monocytes (Mono), platelets (Plt),
mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

3. Buildiing the model. To build the main predictive model, we used a
linear method such as ridge regression with regularization.

Results
● Made a predictive model that diagnoses babesiosis with 93%
accuracy
● Substantiated the significance of the results from both a biologicaal and
statistical point of view
Results
Parameter Reason for its change Reference values
Erythrocytes In 71% of sick dogs, the blooed levels are low. Associated with 5,60-8,00 (> 6 month);
hemolytic anemia. 4,70-6,30 (3-6 month);
3,40-4,90 (up to 2
month)
Leukocytes Decreased in 71.19% of sick dogs. Associated with cortisol and 6,0 - 16,0
hypersensitivity reactions
Band neutrophils 80.8% of dogs are normal. Associated with the absence of a 0 - 3
strong neutrophilic response
Segmented neutrophils 49% of sick dogs are normal. Associated with the absence of a 60 - 70
strong neutrophilic response
Monocytes 80% of dogs with the disease are normal. Relative monocytosis 2 - 7
is associated with a cytokine storm
Platelets In 96.77% of sick dogs, the levels are decreaseed. Associated 160 - 550
with sequestration in the spleen.
Interpretation of results
Our hypothesis. At the moment, the
correlation between the presence of
babesiosis and the results of a clinical blooed
test has not been statistically proven and
has been used by veterinarians only based
on their experience.
Graph of the dependence of the
Currrentlly, our model is imperfect due to a
model accuracy on the number of
lack of data.
dogs in the sample
Conclusions
Our research will help veterinarians diagnose the disease much faster.
The research specifically on babesiosis in this area is new, but statistical
data processing in the field of veterinary science and medicine in general
is currentlly relavant, which further reinforce the relevance of our
research. We see the application of our work in the use of the model in a
program for easier and faster analysis of clinical blooed tests.
