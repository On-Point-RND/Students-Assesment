Problem statement

What exactly are we solving?
Improving the quality of sequential investment decisions in financial markets.
Enhancing risk management in volatile market conditions.
Optimizing teamwork and communication among agents in financial decision-making systems.
Adapting financial decision-making systems to handle multi-asset portfolios.


Challenges:
Inefficient teamwork of agents
Inadequate risk control
Limited adaptability of multi-agent systems
Information overload of agents
Absence of a clear optimization objective

Scope:
Single stock trading
Portfolio management
Enhancing risk management using CVaR and verbal reinforcement mechanisms
Improving the integration of multi-modal market data to make informed trading decisions

Methods

Approach:
Large Language Models (LLMs)
Multi-Agent System (MAS)
Conceptual verbal reinforcement
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
Textual gradient descent
Mean-variance optimization

Methods

LLMs: reasoning, planning, and decision-making capabilities, human-like communication and flexible structures
MAS: real-world investment firms' hierarchical structure
Conceptual verbal reinforcement: iteratively improving reasoning and decision-making
CVaR: quantification of investment risks
Textual gradient descent: optimization of policies in a verbal reinforcement manner
Mean-variance optimization: determination of the portfolio weights for all stocks by considering the statistical correlations between stock returns

Methods

How it works:
LLMs: use pre-trained knowledge to understand and generate human-like text for reasoning and decision-making;
MAS: multiple agents with specific roles collaborate to solve complex tasks, improving efficiency and reducing workload;
Conceptual verbal reinforcement: translates experiences and outcomes into actionable insights that reinforce future decisions;
CVaR: measures the expected loss in the worst-case scenarios, helping to manage and mitigate risk;
Textual gradient descent: Fine-tunes the LLM prompts based on performance feedback to optimize decision-making;
Mean-variance optimization: balances expected returns with risk to determine optimal portfolio weights.

Methods

Data & preprocessing:
Data collection: multi-modal market data, textual news, financial reports, audio from earnings calls, and tabular time series data

Cleaning data: filtering out market noise to extract key insights

Feature extraction: analyst agents extract insights and sentiments from textual data, interpret investment signals from audio data, and compute financial metrics from tabular data

Results

Key findings of the article:
FINCON enhances performance in both single stock trading and portfolio management tasks;
The dual-level risk control mechanism effectively manages market risk and improves trading performance;
The manager-analyst hierarchical structure improves the quality of decision-making while reducing communication costs;
Conceptual verbal reinforcement contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of the framework.

Results

Metrics used:
Daily Profit & Loss (PnL) as the reward function (indicates the immediate profitability of the trading decisions)
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for risk management (quantifies the expected loss during adverse scenarios)
Cumulative trading reward to measure the overall performance of the system (balancing profit with risk)
Sharpe Ratio (measures risk-adjusted return, a higher Sharpe ratio suggests better performance)
