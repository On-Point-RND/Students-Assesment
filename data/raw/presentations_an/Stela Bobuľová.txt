INTRODUCTION
Context:
 Neuromorphic computing is a promising field in
robotics
 [location] is taking its first steps in this area
Projet Goal:
Study neuromorphic networks and apply them to robot
motion control
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Object: Bipedal robot (analogous to human gait)
Goal:
• Ensure stable movement without loss of
balance
Method: Reinforcement learning (reward/punishment
for steps and falls)
NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
Genetic algorithms + Central Pattern Generator (CPG)
Weight modifications based on:
 [surname] et al. (2007) — Spiking CPG networks
 [surname] (2009) — Control of a five-link mecanism
NETWORK ARCHITECCTURE
RESULTS
Achievements:
The robot successfully
moves forward without
falling
Demo:
Video link: Walking
Record
CONCLUSIONS
Outcome:
Neuromorphic approach is effective for gait control
Areas for improvement:
 Optimizing training speed
 Adapting to complex terrains
