Diffusion Probabilistic Models and
AudioX: Diffusion Transformeer for
Anything-to-Audio Generation
[name] [surname]
Introduction
Denoisinng diffusion models (DDMs) are generative models that iteratively refiine data
by learning to reverse a gradual noisinng process.
Advaantages over GANs/VAEs: stable training, mode coverage, and theoretical
grounding.
Unifies ideas from score matching, variational inference, and autoregressive models.
Introduction
What is the topic?
● AudioX: A Diffusion Transformeer (DiT) model
for anything-to-audio generation (text, video,
image, music → audio).
● Unifies multi-modal inputs via masked
training and diffusion.
Why is it important?
● Breaks modality barriers (e.g., text + video →
synchronized audio).
● Achieves SOTA on benchmaarks (Inception
score: 20.27 on VGGSound).
Problem statement
Chalallenges:
● Existing models are modality-specific (text-onlly or video-onlly).
● Scarcity of high-quality multi-modal datasets.
Scope:
● AudioX’s unified architecture + curated datasets (V2M-caps: 6M
music captions).
Diffusion probability model
method
Diffusion models are based on the idea of gradually adding noise to data
(forward process) and then reconstructing the data from the noise (reverse
process).
The forward process is modeled as a Markov chain, where at each step,
noise is added to the data according to the equation:
Diffusion probability model
method
The reverse process is trained to gradually remove noise from corrupted data,
step by step. It learns to predict and reverse the diffusion (noise addition)
performeed in the forward process.

Why Diffusion Models outppeform
other approaches
vs GANs:
● More stable training (no mode collapse).
● Produces diverse outputs without artifacts.
vs Autoregressiive Models:
● Parallel generation (faster than sequential).
● Better long-range coherence (e.g., in
music/audio).

AudioX method
AudioX is the same diffusion model (like DDPM or
Stable Diffusion), but:
1. For audio: Generates sound/music from
noise.
2. Univeersal: Accepts any input type (text,
video, images, audio).
3. Key trick: Uses input-level masking (not
feature masking) for cross-modal learning.
Like Stable Diffusion for images, but for sound +
understands mixed inputs (video/text/images).
Datasets
1. General Diffusion Models (e.g., 2. AudioX’s Datasets
Stable Diffusion). Image Datasets:
● VGGSound-Caps: 190K video-audio pairs +
text captions, covers diverse sounds (e.g.,
● LAION-5B (5.85B image-text
instruments, nature)
pairs)
● V2M-Caps: 6M music clips with
● COCO (330K images with
genrre/mood/tempo labels, enables
captions)
fine-grained music generation
● FFHQ (70K high-res faces)
● Augmentation: Uses Qwen2-Audio to
Key Features: auto-generate captions for video-onlly data
● Large-scale, web-crawled
(LAION)
● Curated for quality (FFHQ)
● Text-aligneed (COCO)
AudioX Evaluation Metrics
Explained
IS (Incption Score): Measures audio quality and diversity (higher is better).
FAD (Fréchet Audio Distance): Evaluates similarity to real recordings (lower is better).
KL (KL Divergence): Quantifies acoustic similarity to ground truth (lower is more
accuraate).
CLAP Score: Assesses text-audio alignment (higher is better).
IB (ImageBind AV Score): Rates video-audio synchronizaation (higher is better).
PC (Production Complexity): Scores musical arrangement complexity (1-10 scale).
PQ (Production Quality): Evaluates music production quality (1-10 scale).
OVL (Overall Quality): User-rated output quality (1-100 scale).
REL (Relevance): Judges input-output matching (1-100 scale).
Results
AudioX, key Metrics:
Text-to-Audio (T2A):
● IS: 20.27 (VGGSound) – beats AudioGen (11.09) & AudioLDM-2 (13.86).
● FAD: 1.31 – better quality than compeitors (AudioGen: 2.48).
Video-to-Audio (V2A):
● KL: 2.5, outppeforms FoleyCrafter (2.39), strong video-audio alignment (IB: 0.26).
Text-to-Music (T2M):
● IS: 3.54 (MusicCaps) – higher than MusiGen (2.24).
● FAD: 1.53 – more natural output than MAGNET (4.24).
Multi-Modal (TV2A/TV2M):
● IS: 17.89 (TV2A), 1.51 (TV2M) – excels with combiined inputs.
User Ratings: top scores in quality (OVL) & relevance (REL).
Conclusion
1. First model to unify diverse audio generation
tasks
2. Addresses critical data scarcity through
novel dataset creation
3. Demonstrates superior performaance across
all metrics
