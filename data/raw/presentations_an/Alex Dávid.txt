Conclusions
1. Approximations of the central moments of impurity propagation are obtained.
The best model: ANN
• Approximation of Δ shows no dependence, which confirms the hypothesis that the
y
target variable corresponds on average to the source position, and in our case also
depends on the turbulent structures.
• Approximation of Δ shows a slight improvement over the empirical Briggs model,
z
which shows a tendency to capture universal dependencies f = f(z/h)
• Approximations of σ , σ gives a significant improvement over the empirical Briggs
y z
model.
2. The ML models give better results compared to the empirical Briggs model, showing
the effectiveness of the models in solving this problem
3. The results of significance of model features allow us to evaluate the importance of
taking into account physical parameters in further development of physical problem
statements and numerical modeling
