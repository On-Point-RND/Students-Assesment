WORK EXPERIENCE
ML Engineer June 2023 – Present
[compaany] [location]
[compaany] is a BigTech company that is part of a large bank with over 100 million users.
● Implemented DoReMi optimization for the training stage of the largest LLM in the CIS called GigaChat (20M+ active users), which improved the model's quality by 10%.
● Trained and released 23 monolinguaal LLMs called mGPT, improving the quality of the multilinguaal mGPT from 47% to 2900% depending on the language. Each model has been downloaded more than 2000 times.
● Developed and led (a team of 8 members) a benchmark called LIBRA for evaluating LLMs with long contexts. The benchmark has over 1000 downloads on HuggingFace (HuggingFace: datasets/ai-forever/LIBRA).
● Built an environment for 25 AI agents with different personalities using LLM called GigaChat.
Stack: Python, Pytorch, Pandas, Megatron, Deepspeed, vLLM, Git, Azure, ClearML, Docker
ML Engineer September 2021 – May 2023
[compaany] [location]
[compaany] develops the leading EDM system in the CIS for more than 120 companies.
● Developed an algorithm based on image segmentation for quickly finding stamps on documents (processing speed increased by 200%).
● Optimized an algorithm for borderless table detection using Faster R-CNN, which improved the detection quality by 45%.
● Designed an algorithm for NER by experimenting with BiLSTM, BERT, Transformeers and CRF (Transformeers + CRF was chosen as the best in quality, F1 increased by 18%).
● Developed OCR for identity documents using char segmentation and classification (metrics increased by 60%).
● Led a team of 5 members and mentored 2 of them.
Stack: Python, C#, Pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Pandas, vLLM, SQL, Git, Azure, ClearML, Docker
ML Engineer September 2018 – August 2021
[compaany] [location]
● Participated in NeurIPS 2021, where I won first place in the IGLU competition sponsored by Microsoft and Google. This work was published in PMLR (JMLR): [url]
● Developed the bionic arm and Brain-Computer Interface for controlling the bionic arm with using neural networks.
● Developed a neural network algorithm to quickly find cars on a video data stream (speed increased by 250%).
Stack: Python, C++, Pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Pandas, SQL, Git, Azure, ClearML, Docker
