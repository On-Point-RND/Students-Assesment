What is KAN?
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem:
If 𝑓(𝒙) is a continuous function of several variables,
then 𝑓(𝒙) can be written as a finite composition of one variable continuous functions
and an addition operation.

λ-KAN. Mathematics
The main result: sensitivity of λ-KAN to input-vector ~ λ-vector values
under 2 conditions.
Condition n.1: 𝝓 𝑥 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜱 (… ) - independently distributed;
Condition n.2: 𝑥 - have close distributions.

Results
1. Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) - promising analogue of neural networks
2. KAN can be graphically interpreted if architecture is simple enough
3. Introduced λ-KAN incorporates architecture-based explainable sensitivity to
input data
4. λ-KAN has a brilliant ability in verifying inputs` importance. It was showed on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and compared with SHAP and
gradient analysis.
Future work
1. Improve approximation ability of λ-KAN. It can be made by introducing
trainable λ-tensor instead of constant one.
2. Apply λ-KAN in various deep-learning tasks. This provides 2 advantages:
• Mathematically proved interpretation instruments, built in model. KAN
needs only feed-forward procedure, instead of SHAP, Lime, Grad-cam etc..
• Sensitivity, attention learning in the main flow of fitting model (satellite image
segmentation example).
Thank you for attention!
