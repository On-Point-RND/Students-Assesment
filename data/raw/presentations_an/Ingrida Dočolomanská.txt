Decision Transformer:
Reinforcement Learning as Sequence Modeling

Introduction

Decision Transformer – a new take on Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Topic
Why it matters
Transforms RL into a sequence modeling problem, using powerful Transformer networks
Traditional RL
Often struggles with value functions and policy gradients
Goal

Understand how Decision Transformers work and why they're useful

Problem statement

Reinforcement Learning is hard, especially with limited, imperfect data
Problem
Challenges
Errors build up, values get overestimated, and it's tough to figure out which actions lead to long-term rewards
Focus
Decision Transformers tackle this by learning the relationships between states, actions, and rewards

Methods

Uses a Transformer architecture (like GPT, but with modifications)
Method
Why Transformers?
Great at understanding long sequences and assigning credit through self-attention.
How it works
The Transformer looks at desired rewards, past states, and actions to decide what to do next

PPO vs. Decision Transformer

This experiment compares two reinforcement learning algorithms – PPO and DT
Methods
Environment
HalfCheetah-v4. A simulated 2D cheetah robot that must learn to run forward. This environment demands long-term planning and efficient exploration

Results

PPO initially learns faster and achieves good performance with reasonable hyperparameter tuning (e.g., average reward ~4200 after X episodes).
DT, with sufficient training data and careful hyperparameter optimization, can surpass PPO’s performance (e.g., average reward ~5700 after Y episodes, with specific tuning of sequence length, embedding dimensions, and learning rate).

What’s Missing?

Decision Transformers can be computationally expensive and sensitive to settings
Limitations
Unresolved Issues
Offline RL still has challenges that Decision Transformers don't completely solve
Why it's important
Addressing these limitations can make RL more practical in real-world situations
Future
Combining Decision Transformers with other techniques and applying them to new areas
