Diffusion process
There are 2 distributions: and which is a normal distribution.
We want to transfer from prior to data distributions.
the process is the solution to this SDE

Problem statement
• Problems occurs if we want to transfer data not from normal distribution but from other domains of
data. For example, from image to video.
Lack of cyclic consistency — basic diffusion models do not provide reversibility of
○
transformations, which is logically expected in Image2Image problems.
Ideological problems — existing diffusion formulas are difficult to adapt to problems with
○
meaningful data (not noise), indicating theoretical incompleteness.
Heavyness of methods — alternative approaches, such as Schrödinger bridges, are
○
computationally intensive, which encourages the search for easier solutions.
