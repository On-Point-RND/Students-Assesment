setup, excel at creating realistic images but suffer from
training instability and mode collapse. CycleGAN,
StyleGAN, and BigGAN are notable GAN architectures.

Generation of Synthetic Images for Enhancing Tree Species

Overall, the research demonstrates a promising outlook for using
generative models, especially diffusion models, to overcome the data
scarcity problem in image classification tasks within sustainable
forest management. While potential drawbacks associated with the
indiscriminate addition of synthetic data need to be consideered, the
identified benefiits in improving the recognition of rare species
suggest a significant potenial for this technoolgy. Future work on
rifining the selection of generated images and exploring alternative
architectures could lead to even more significant results in the field
of environmental management and sustainable innovation.
