Introduction
‚ùì What is the topic?
Detection and classification of audio degradations using deep learning.
üí° Why is it important?
Audio distortions reduce the quality of speech recognition and other audio-based AI systems. Automatic detection helps improve
prepocessing, data quality, and model robustness.
üìö Background
We use a CNN trained on Mel spectrograms to detect distortions like noise, clipping, pitch shift, filtering, etc., segmenting audio into
1-second chunks for fine-grained classification. The dataset is based on LibriSpeech with synthetic degradaations.
üéØ Goal of the review
To show how deep models can identiify and localize audio degradations, and why it‚Äôs useful for buildiing cleaner, more reliable speech
datasets.
Problem statement
What exactlly are we solving?
I aim to automatically detect and classify degradaations in audio at the segment level, using deep learning.
Challenges
‚óè Fine-grained annotation is rarely available
‚óè Audio distortions vary in intensity and type
‚óè Some degradaations are hard to distinguish (e.g., pitch shift vs. stretch)
‚óè Data imbalance and synthetic noise realism
Scope
‚óè 1-second resolution detection
‚óè Multilabel classification for 7 degradation types + clean class
‚óè Based on modified LibriSpeech and augmented samples
‚óè CNN on Mel-spectrogram input
Methods
Approach
I use a CNN-based model for multilabel classification on audio segments represented as Mel spectrograms.
Why these methods?
CNN-based model provides a good trade-off between accuracy and speed, and works well on spectrogram-like inputs due to its visual
nature.
Mel spectrograms compactly represent time-frequency information relevant to degradaations.
How it works (simply)
Each audio file is split into 1-second fragments, converted to Mel spectrograms, and passed through the model to predict the
presence of 7 possible distortions or a clean class.
Data & preprocessing
‚óè Base data: LibriSpeech
‚óè Synthetic degradaations added via audiomentaions
‚óè Features: Mel spectrograms (log-scaled)
‚óè Stratified train/val split; segment-level labels in .csv format
Results
Key findiings
‚óè The model detects audio degradaations at 1-second
resolution with high confidence for major distortions.
‚óè Classes like ClippingDistortion and
AddGaussianNoise show strong separability.
‚óè Clean segments (None) are accurately identified
when clearly separated from noise.
Metrics used
‚óè Macro F1-score: accounts for class imbalance,
ensuring all distortion types are considered.
‚óè Per-class accuracy: reveals weaak spots for rare or
subtle degradaations.
‚óè Total accuracy: measures general prediction quality.
Research gap
What‚Äôs missing?
‚óè Real-world impairments are often not synthetic, unlike the augmentaations
