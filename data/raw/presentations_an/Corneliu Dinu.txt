The Tree of Knowledge: To Reveal Concepts in
Natural Texts with Complex Networks

Introduction
• Topic: Extraccting scientific concepts from natural language texts using complex networks.
• During early discussions with my supervisor, we noticed something strange in embedding spaces—
empty regions that no word seemed to occupy. These “holes” hinted at gaps in our semantic
understanding. Could we create a map of all concepts that not onlny shows the words, but the relations
and structures that connect them?
• While language models map words into space, they don’t fully capture the structure of knowledge. We
need more than isolated embeddings—we need graphs to represent how scientific ideas relate.
• The goal is to create a semantic graph from scientific texts, where nodes represent concepts and edges
represent meaningful relationships, enabling deeper exploration of science as a structured space.
Problem statement
• Traditional embeddings miss the structure of knowledge. We’re solving the problem of buildiing a
comprehensive, interpretable map of scientific terms and their relationships.
• Focus on buildiing a rule-based graph from arXiv texts in computer science. The solution must be scalable,
interpretable, and semantically rich. The vertices must visualize scientific terms, edges – relations.
Word2Vec is a technique in natural
language processing that transforms words
into numerical vectors in a way that
captures their meanings and the
relationships between them. Essentially, it
learns to represent each word as a point in a
high-dimensional space, where words with
similar meanings or that appear in similar
contexts end up close together in that
space.
Methods
Approach:
• NLP: SpaCy for parsing and resolving references.
• Embeddings: CBOW (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams)
• Clustering: DBSCAN, Wishart
How it works:
• Extract noun groups (concepts) and verbs/prepositions (relations) from text → embed → cluster
→ build graph → analyze.
Data & preprocessing:
• Load arXiv.org papers as HTML.
• Remove images, formulas, etc., and leave only texts.
• Resolve coreferences.
• Extracted structured relationships from sentences
Vertice Merging
The problem:
• Different authors use different terms for the same idea (e.g., “node” vs. “vertex”).
Solution:
• Embed all concepts and use semantic proximity to merge similar ones. This “squeezing” step
reduces redundaancy and connects disconnected concepts.
Technique:
• Embedding + ϵ-neighborhood clustering.
Edge Clustering
Observation:
• Scientific relationships are surprisiingly limited—maybbe 10–15 core relation types.
Approach:
• Embed edge types (verb + preposition) and cluster into logical groups like location, causation,
equality, etc.
Technique:
• Fewer, more meaningful edge types make the graph simpler and more powerful for analysis.
Isomorphism Search
The big idea:
• Scientific domains that are well understood form cliques—densely connected concept
networks.
Why cliques?:
• In fields like physics, concepts like velocity, mass, force, and acceleleration all relate to each other.
That’s a clique. Identiifying these in other domains helps detect well-structured knowledge or
knowlleidge gaps.
GoaL:
• Find cliques in one area, then search for isomorphic cliques in others. That’s how we “map”
unknown territories of knowlleidge.
Current status:
• Architecture is ready. Isomorphism algorithm (Fuzzy RDF) still under development due to
complexity.
Results
Repository: https://github.com/[name]/concept-tree
Key findiings:
• Large connected component + smaller isolated
clusters
• Identified semantic hubs: (e.g. “formula”, “task”,
“model”, “we”, “approaach”)
Research Prospects
What’s missing:
• Mathematical expressions not yet included
• Isomorphism search pending due to resource limits
Why it matters:
• Mapping cliques and their analogs helps reveal hidden knowlleidge structures. Filling these gaps
could acceelerate scientific discovery. This approaach also helps to generalize knowlleidge between
scientific areas.
Future opportunities:
• Integrate formulas and figures
• Finish isomorphism search and publish results
