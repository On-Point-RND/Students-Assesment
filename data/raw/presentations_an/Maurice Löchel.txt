USING RECCOMMENDATION
SYSTEMS FOR CROSS-DOMAIN
DATA
Background
Problem
Low correlation between two domains will impact the performance of
recommendaation system models.
Main Goal
Conduct a study to mathematically calculate the metrics of the CDIMF model
on two completely different domains.
Novelty
Demonstrate that even the most advanced models will have low metrics on
domains with low correlation, using the example of the CDIMF model
deweveloped by [compaany] researchers.
Methods
Problems:
Cold start problem (lack of data on new users/items)
Data sparsiity (few user interactions)
Domain inconsistency (different rating scales, user behavior patterns)
Solution:
Knowledge transfer between domains to improve predictions
Methods
In cross-domain implicit matrix factorization models, the overall
loss function includes three components:
- reconstruction error for each domain
- Regulraization of latent factors
- Penalty for deviation of local factors from global
ensures consistency across domains.
Methods
With thematic proximity of domains, matrices P (1) and P (2) are
correlated, which affects the latent factors X (k) and Y (k) to be more
easily matched through Z.
Thus, the overall error is reduced. Accordiingly, we hypothesize that
with low covariance of latent features, the loss function will increase.
Results
Let's consider hypothetical domains D1 and D2 with latent space dimension d=2, as well as 2
scenarios of different covariance - high and low.
With high covariance 0.7 in domain Xu(1) = [0.8,0.2] and domain Xu(2) = [0.75,0.25], the penalty ρ =
0.0025 (where ρ is a hyperparameter), and the loss function is 0.0025. With low covariance 0.1, the
penalty ρ = 0.25, and the loss function is 0.2824.
• High covariance (0.7):
Covariance Level Error
Error: 0.0025
High (0.7) 0.0025
• Low covariance (0.1):
Low E(0rr.1o)r: 0.2824 0.2824
Conclusion:
Recommendaation quality depends on domain similarity
Accordiingly, the hypothesis about low-correlating domains is confirmed by the increase in error.
Results
The practical application of this hypothesis is that the domains
[location] - [location]
[location] - [location]
will show more relevant products to the user than the domains
[location] - Cooking
Conclusions
Models that perform well in one domain may show poor performaance in
another due to differences in latent factors.
Low feature correlation between domains leads to an increase in prediction
error (reconstruction error).
Experiments with the CDIMF model confirmed that with high covariance
(0.7), the error is minimal (0.0025), whereas with low covariance (0.1), it
increases to 0.2824.
The best results are achieved on thematically related domains ([location] –
[location], Phones – Electronics).
