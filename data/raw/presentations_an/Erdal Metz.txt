Introduction
Topic: Neural Networks for Structured
Grid Generation (revision of my paper)
Importance: Physical Simulations, e.g., in
High Energy Physics or Electrodynamics
Goals of review: connect current
research with Data-Driven approaches
Problem statement
Optical fiber modelling
Challenges
Goal
ùêπ
Good grid Bad grid
Scope
Coordinate Physical Domains that are:
domain domain ‚Ä¢ 2D or 3D
‚Ä¢ N-connected
‚Ä¢ Piecewise smooth at
boundary
Methods
‚Ä¢ Input points are generated in a square/cubic mesh
‚Ä¢ All coordinates are normalized
Input ‚Ä¢ Train, Validation and Test subsets are created
‚Ä¢ Inputs are embedded to also have Fourier Features (differentiable
Fourier operation) for better processing of sharp corners
Features
‚Ä¢ Physics-Informed Loss is written to meet requirements on the mesh:
smooth gradients w.r.t. inputs, orthogonality, etc.
Loss
‚Ä¢ Residual Neural Network with many skip-connections is used to
make the NN learn small transformations between layers
Residual NN
Results
1. Complex geometries parametrized
a. Quality of grid: Winslow, Liao,
Orthogonality;
b. Quality of boundaries: MSE
c. Quality of PDE solution: RMSE
Complex geometry with
Physical simulation error
refinement
d. Complicated geometries were over time (FDTD)
considered, having strong non-convex
boundaries and multiple-
connectedness.
e. In all aspects, the proposed net
performs MGNet.
2. Mesh refinement tested
3. Quality of PDE solution on the domain
is improved compared to classical grids
Research gap
‚Ä¢ The method is not robust enough in terms of convergence.
‚Ä¢ The method is slow if many domains are to be parametrized.
‚Ä¢ Data-driven approaches for structured grid generation are in a raw stage.
‚Ä¢ Generative models could provide a way to generate grids as a single forward-pass.
‚Ä¢ By gathering the knowledge from summer school, I would try to overcome this gap.
