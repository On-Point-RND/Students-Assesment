Research context

Key Question: Does H-LoRA maintain its advantages in narrow specialized domains, or is standard LoRA sufficient for such focused applications?
Research Focus:
Clinical reality: specialists often work within specific imaging modalities or anatomical areas
Does architectural complexity of H-LoRA provide meaningful benefiits in homogeneous datasets?
Cost-benefiit analysis for practical clinical deployment

H-LoRA Architecture and Key Components

SLAKE: Medical Imaging Dataset

SLAKE: Subdomens

Models Architecture:
H-LoRA experiments: CLIP-L/14 (visual encoder) + Phi-3-mini (3.8B LLM)
LoRA experiments: Gemma3-4b (4B LLM)
LoRA rank: R=16
Evaluation Metrics:
ROUGE-1: For open-ended text generation tasks
Accuracy: For closed diagnostic tasks with definitive answeers
Overall accuracy across all question types
Experimental Configurations:
LoRA trained on X-ray subdomain only
LoRA trained on full SLAKE dataset
H-LoRA trained on X-ray subdomain only
H-LoRA trained on full SLAKE dataset

Key observations:
H-LoRA shows a slight advantage in ROUGE-1 scores (0.7351 vs 0.7314), indicating better performance on open-ended tasks
Standard LoRA demonstrates superior accuracy (0.7204 vs 0.6902) for closed diagnostic questions
The heterogeneous nature of the dataset reveals different strengths of each approach
H-LoRA's architecture seems to handle diverse modalities better for generative tasks
LoRA provides more precise classification despite simpler architecture
Implications: When working with diverse medical imaging datasets, the choice between H-LoRA and LoRA should be guided by the specific task requirements.

Key findings:
Standard LoRA outperforms H-LoRA on ROUGE-1 (0.7889 vs 0.7821) for open-ended text generation
H-LoRA maintains stronger performance on accuracy metrics (0.7327 vs 0.7243)
The performance gap between methods narrows in this specialized domain
LoRA shows remarkable efficiency for generative tasks in homogeneous data
H-LoRA maintains advantages for classification tasks even in narrow domains
Domain-specific insights: The more homogeneous nature of the X-ray subdomain appears to reduce some advantages of H-LoRA's complex architecture while highlightiing its strengths in specific classification scenarios.

Future Directions

Comparing XLoRA (expert-based approach) on the full dataset with standard LoRA
Investigating visual reasoning capabilities, as tests showed that certain errors persist regarldess of LoRA rank
Exploring more complex model architectures rather than simply increasing adapter rank
Developing hybrid approaches combining the advantages of both methods
Testing on other narrow domains (CT and MRI of specific organs)
