methodology behind the ViEWS forecasting
system, a cutting-edge tool for predicting political
violence in [location].
Why is it important?
Armed conflicts cause thousands of deaths and
displace millions each year. Predicting and
preventing these conflicts could save countless
lives and mitigate humanitarian crises.
Problem statement
The task was to accurately predict the risk and localization of three types of organized violence in [location]:
• State-based conflicts;
• non-State conflicts;
• unilateral violence against civilians.
Challenges: Existing early warning systems often lacked transparency about their methods, had gaps in
coverage, or were not publicly available, which limited their usefulness to researchers and decision makers.
Scope of application: ViEWS generates monthly forecasts of the probability and geographical distribution of
violent events in [location] at both country and subnational levels, calculated 36 months in advance.
Methods
Approach
To tackle the multifaceted nature of conflict prediction, ViEWS employs an ensemble approach,
combining logistic regression and random forest models. The models consider a range of
factors, including conflict history, geographic location, socioeconomic indicators, political
institutions, and the influence of neighboring conflicts, to assess the likelihood of future violence.
Data Sources
⦁ Conflicts: UCDP-GED (georeferenced events) and UCDP-Candidate (monthly updates).
⦁ Socio-economic Data: World Bank (GDP, economic growth), PRIO-GRID (population,
infrastructure).
⦁ Political Factors: V-Dem (institutions, democracy), ACLED (protests).
How it works
The model operates on two levels of analysis: country (country-months) and subnational (PRIO-
GRID), combining forecasts from thematic models to improve accuracy. Dynamic modeling and the
"one step forward" method allow the system to update forecasts on a monthly basis and take into
account time dependencies.

Results
The ViEWS ensemble models have exhibited exceptional predictive performance, effectively forecasting the
continuation of ongoing conflicts and the spread of violence to adjacent regions.
The system's effectiveness is meticulously
evaluated using a combination of metrics, including
the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall
curve (AUPR), and Brieer score. These metrics
provide a balanced assessment of the models'
ability to identify high-risk cases while minimizing
false alarms.
A striking visual representation of the system's
capabilities can be seen in the map of predicted
probabilities for state-based conflict in October
2018. This map vividly illustrates ViEWS' capacity to
pinpoint high-risk regions across [location] by
intelligently analyzing historical patterns and
contextual factors.
AUROC = 0.955 (country level),
0.948 (subnational level)
Research gap
What’s missing? Unresolved challenges:
1. Data Dependency Limitations 1. Onset of New Conflicts
The ViEWS system heavily relies on open-source data, which can lead to
fluctuations in predictive accuracy due to
data quality or availability.
2. Geographic Focus
The ViEWS models are primarily tailored
for [location], limiting their applicability in
other regions.
2. Dynamic Factors and Their Influence
The complexity of predicting conflicts is
exacerbated by the ever-changing
political environments and the emergence
of new influential actors.
Why it matters?
Expanding the system's geographical
coverage will enhance its use in
international conflict prevention
efforts. By identifying potential conflicts
in various regions, the models can inform
a broader range of stakeholders and
enable timely interventions, thus reducing
risks on a larger scale.
Future opportunities:
1. Incorporating Diverse Data Sources
2. Globalization of the Model
