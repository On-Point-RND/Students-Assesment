- The same syndrome can be produced by many error

TRUE PREDICTED
- Incorrect prediction of only one qubit leads to incorrect

TransformeTransformer- based attention attention Why recurrent GNN is a perfect cnoi choice:
- The structure of the surface code fits perfectlly
on the graph structure
- Scalability due to the graph attention
3. No memory NN RNN with memory

- The recurrent structure corresponds to real
