Objective & Relevance

Objective:
Leverage GNN-based surrogate* models to accelerate and improve AutoML pipeline optimization
AutoML
Data Preparation
Feature Engineering
Model Selection and Optimization
Evaluation of a large number of different models and configurations
A complex and time-consuming process
Example of a Machine Learning Pipeline
* A surrogate model is a simplified and more cost-effective model used in place of a more complex and accurate one.

Solution:Using previously known information about models trained on similar datasets — MetaAutoML.

Results and Future works

Surrogate Performance:
RankNet early-fusion: Kendall-Tau ≈ 0.53, Precision ≈ 0.25 (pyMFE features)
Surrogate reduces design time from ~690 min to ~30 min

Future Work:
Broader evaluation with more datasets and regression tasks.
Improved pipeline ranking methods.
Extend to text/image data using feature engineering and LLLMs for pipeline selection/predictions.
