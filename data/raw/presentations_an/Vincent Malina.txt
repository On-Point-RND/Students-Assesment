Introduction
What is the topic?
The topic of this research is the generation of fonts using diffusion models, focusing on creating missing
glyphs for various languages and maintaining stylistic consistency in font design.
Why is it important?
Font development plays a crucial role in creating aesthetically pleasing and functional designs. However, the
field faces challenges due to licensing restrictions and limited availability of fonts for different world
languages. Many digital fonts primarily support English, lacking characters for extended Cyrillic, Latin, and
other writing systems. This creates difficulties for designers working on multilingual projects or with non-
standard alphabets.
Problem statement
What exactly are we solving?
Challenge of automating font creation, particularly focusing on generating missing glyphs for various
languages and maintaining stylistic consistency across different characters. The goal is to develop a system
that can create high-quality fonts for languages with limited digital support, such as extended Cyrillic and Latin
character sets, while overcoming limitations imposed by traditional font licensing restrictions.
Problem statement
Challenges
• Limited availability of fonts for many world languages, especially those using non-Latin alphabets or
extended character sets.
• Licensing restrictions that limit font usage and modification, creating barriers for designers working on
multilingual projects.
• Handling complex characters and decorative elements while preserving visual quality and readability.
• Managing kerning and tracking issues, particularly for challenging character pairs.
Problem statement
Scope
• The study focuses on developing a diffusion model-based solution for font generation that:
• Can work with limited input data (few-shot learning capabilities).
• Generates high-quality vector fonts with consistent styling across all characters.
• Supports multiple languages and character sets beyond standard English.
• Provides tools for automatic generation of missing glyphs while maintaining original font characteristics.
Methods
• Approach: The study utilizes diffusion models, specifically a modified UNet architecture with added
attention layers and sinusoidal positional embeddings.
• Why these methods? Diffusion models were chosen as they excel at generating high-quality images while
maintaining stylistic consistency. The UNet architecture allows for effective noise reduction and feature
extraction.
• How it works: The model progressively denoises input images while using style and class encoders to
maintain font characteristics, generating new glyphs that match the original font's style.
• Data & preprocessing: 32x32 pixel raster images of 11,756 Latin alphabet fonts. The dataset was split into
80% training, 10% validation, and 10% testing sets.
