Feature extraction  
Descriptors:  
PAAC: the proportion of each type of amino acid in the sequence + information about the order of their sequence  
APAAC: PAAC based on hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity  
QSO: a matrix of distances between 20 amino acids  
Autocorrelation (MBAuto, GAuto, CTD...) is a class of descriptors that describe the level of correlation between two sequences based on their structural or physico-chemical properties.  
Embeddings  
ESM - 2  
proteinBERT  
Descriptors  
physico-chemical properties (hydrophilicity, isoelectric point, etc.)  
properties depending on amino acid composition and order  
One-hot encoding, TF-IDF
