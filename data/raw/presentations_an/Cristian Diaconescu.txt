Introduction
Topic: Predicting gas well flow rates using production data
Importance: Enables efficient field development management, early detection of complications, and timely,
effective reservoir management
Data Source: Data from [location]'s largest gas field
Goal: To develop and evaluate ML/DL models for accurate short-to-medium term flow rate prediction,
enabling the early detection of production complications and supporting timely reservoir management
Problem statement
Problem: Time-series forecasting of individual well gas flow rate
Input Data: Historical time-series measurements (Q, T, P ,P ,dP=P −P ) and static well characteristics (X
static buffer reservoir bhp surface/Bottom
,Y , TD, TVDSS, d θ , D )
hole surface/Bottom hole casing, max packer/tubing
Challenges:
• Temporal dependencies and non-stationarity
• Missing data and potential outliers
• Complex, non-linear relationships between features and flow rate
• Varying behavior across different wells and time periods
• Need for careful feature engineering and time-aware validation
Scope: Well-level prediction on a time-ordered hold-out test set. Focus on denormalized metrics for real-world interpretation.
Methodology
Data Cleaning: Datetime conversion, categorical encoding (LabelEncoder for simplicity).
Missing Value Imputation:
• Static Features:Grouped forward/backward fill per well (maintains well consistency) + global mean/median for remaining NaNs.
• Dynamic Numerical Features:KNNImputer(captures inter-feature relationships).
Feature Engineering:
• Temporal Features:Year, Month, DayOfWeek, DayOfYear
• Lag Features:Previous values of Qand P (crucial for time context).
buffer
• Rolling Window Features: Mean/Std Dev of Qand P over 7, 14, 30 day windows (captures recent trends/volatility).
buffer
Outlier Handling:IQR-based clipping (limits extreme values without data loss).
Scaling:StandardScaler on features; separate StandardScaler on the target variable (Q)to facilitate accurate denormalization for evaluation.
Methodology
Models Compared:
• RandomForestRegressor:Ensemble baseline, robust to defaults.
• XGBRegressor: Gradient Boosting, often state-of-the-art for tabular data.
• SVR: Support Vector Regresssion, different paradigm (kernel methods). Tuned via GridSearchCV with TimeSeriesSplit (essential for time-
series CV)
• LSTM: Recurrent Neural Network, designed for sequntial data. Used n lookback sequences, Dropout, EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint.
Train/Test Split: Strict time-based split (last 20% of data as test set) to simulate real-world deployment.
Evaluation Metrics: Calculated on denormalized (original scale) predictions:
• MAE(Mean Absolute Error)
• RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error)
• R² (Coefficient of Determination)
