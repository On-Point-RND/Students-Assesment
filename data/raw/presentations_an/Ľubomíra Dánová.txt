Introduction
• Recent trends in AGI combiine leaps and gradual results, but what is it all for?
• However, there is still a problem: abstracting away from knowlage of the real world. Models are too
detached from the world, they lack the basis of common sense assumptions that people have.
• The purpose of the review: to explore the main approahes for incorporating world knowlage into models,
to analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and also to propose approahes to people.
Problem statement
• The main problem is the lack of influence of 'common sense' on the respoonse of models and the
hallucinations that follow.
• The objectives are to study existing approahes based on three papers, to look at their results, to draw
paraallels with human thinking, and to draw conclusions.
Methods
Human methods
Abstract reasoning
A picture of world
Just say: I don’t know
based on experience
Abstract reasoning
Suggested solutions:
• AbsAcc Abstract Thinking Test
• MeanLearn Learning Method
World Knowledge Model
Create a "world view" for the model:
• Task Knowledge: Provides prioritized
instructions for tasks (e.g. "the egg is most
likely in the fridge").
• State Knowledge: Dynamiically updated
during task execution to avoid
inconsistencies (e.g. "I found an egg, now I
need to wash it").
I Don’t Know
•The [IJDK] token is added to
the model dictionar.
•During additional training,
the loss function is modified:
if the model makes a mistake,
part of the probability is
transferred to [IJDK].
•Regulaization is introduced
to minimize false positives [IJDK]
Results
Abstract reasoning results
[IJDK] Results
World Knowledge model results
Research gap
• These methods can help LLM gives more meainingful answeers, and can improve work of LLM
• On the next step we can improve system of data storage
