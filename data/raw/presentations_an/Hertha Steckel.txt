Abstract
Goal: Automate Multi-agent system design using LLMs for industrial/scientific problem-solving.
Key Innovation: Meta-agent architecture with dynamic agent generation, self-reflection, and evolutionary optimization.
Outcome: Achieved 8.67/10 performance in scientific article summarization, reducing manual design costs.
Introduction
Challenges in MAS Design: Resource-intensive architecture customization, lack of adaptability.
LLM Potential: Code synthesis, context analysis, and self-improvement capabilities.
Research Objective: Develop an LLM-driven framework for automated, adaptive MAS generation.
Problem Statement
Limitations of Traditional MAS:
1. Manual architecture design.
2. Narrow specialization of agents.
3. High development costs.
Need: Scalable, autonomous systems for dynamic environments.
Methods Overview
Three Key Components:
1. Dynamic Agent Generation (LLM-based code synthesis).
2. Automated Evaluation (quality metrics via independent LLM).
3. Self-Reflection (“thought → action → criticism” loop).
System Architecture
Meta-Agent Roles:
• Agent code generation (GPT-4o).
• Archive management (JSON repository).
• Evolutionary optimization (combining successful agents).
Components: Search space, quality assessment function.
Agent Generation Process
Steps:
1. Task initialization (e.g., “analyze scientific articles”).
2. LLM code synthesis (Structured Output pattern).
3. Validation on benchmark data.
4. Self-reflection for error correction.
Experimental Setup
Task: Summarize 250 AI research articles (2024).
Evaluation Metrics: Relevance, coherence, readability, accuracy, conciseness.
Tools: OpenAI API, Qwen2.5 72B (evaluator).
Parameters: Temperature, iteration count, agent attempts.
Analytical Table – Base Agents Performance

Optimized MAS Score:
8.67/10 (vs. baseline 8.4)
Improvement Drivers: Role assignment, diversity in agent combinations.
Results – Temperature Impact
Optimal Temperature: ≤0.5
balances creativity and stability.
High Temperature (>0.7):
Reduced accuracy and coherence.
Discussion – Contributions and Impact
• Theoretical: LLM as a core for self-organizing systems.
• Practical: Reduced development costs, adaptability in dynamic environments (e.g., industrial automation).
Limitations and Future Work
Limitations: LLM dependency, subjective evaluation, narrow task scope.
Future Directions:
• Integration with reinforcement learning.
• Cross-domain validation (e.g., robotics).
Conclusion
• Achievement: Demonstrated LLM-driven MAS outperforms traditional methods.
• Impact: Enables rapid deployment in uncertain, dynamic scenarios.
• Call to Action: Explore integration with broader ML paradigms.
