Sequential recommendaions
Predicts a user's next interaction by analyzing the chronological order and dependencies in their
historical behavior (e.g., clicks, purchases) to capture evolving preferences over time.

Sequential recommendations
Basic Sequential Models - Use RNNs, CNNs, or Markov chains to capture temporal patterns in
user interactions. Examples: GRU4Rec, Caser, NARM.
Transformer-Based Models - Leverage self-attention to model long-range dependencies in
interaction sequences. Examples: SASRec, BERT4Rec, TiSASRec
LLM-Based Models - Fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to generate recommendations
via natural language prompts. Examples: P5, Recformer, M6-Rec.
Multimodal Models - Fuse text, images, graphs, or time to enhance user/item representations.
Examples: SURGE, M6-Rec, VBPR.
Efficiency-Focused Models - Prioritize speed and scalability for long sequences via linear
architectures. Examples: S4Rec, TASRec, LightSANs.

Impact
● Optimizing an algorithm for Monte-Carlo
estimate of the curvature
through delta-hyperbolicity
● Implementing the several versions algorithm on
GPU and CPU
● Conducting the final experiments
The main hypothesis:
There are 2 types of datasets:
“good” ones: we can leverage the
hyperbolic structure
“bad” ones: it remaiins redundant and,
even can affect the training process

Research Questions Hyperbolic RecSys
Research questions
Q1: How metrics will change if the curvature is a leaarnable parameter?
Q2: Do embeddings in "good" datasets exhibiit a more structured and explainable
distribution compared to "bad" datasets when using pre-defined curvature?
Q3: Are alike sequences located closely in the embedding space, reflecting meaningful
relationships between similar subsequences?
Q4: Does the overall distribution of embeddings align with the initial intuition of hierarchical
clustering near the bounndary and central positioning of earlier elements?
Q5: Is there a single curvature of the inner space?

Experiment Results Hyperbolic RecSys
Plan of an experiment
(Q1-Q4):
● Perform train and test on the best config for
“good” and “bad” datasets with curvature = 1,
precalculated curvature and leaarnable
curvature
● On each epoch collect the features mapped
on the curved space
● Chooose the top-10 largest sequences for
better representation
● Calculate the weighteed Jaccard distance
between each one and the largest sequence,
assign different colors, representing similarity
● Plot the distribution on each epoch

Experiment Results Hyperbolic RecSys
Plan of an experiment (Q5):
● Set curvature as 1 (for more hyperbolic) or
small value (for more euclidean)
● After validation take the loggiits of the
model, think of them as high dimensional
points, each point now representing the
sequence, not the item
● Train the model with a new curvature,
repeat the procedure, check the
convergence

Drawing a Conclusion Hyperbolic RecSys
Discussion
(Q1-Q4)
- Q1: The fluctuations in metrics are minor.
- Q2: There is an obvious structure in the "good" datasets as the sequences
are located closely together. However, instead of groupiing on the bounindariies,
the sequences are located in the center.
- Q3: No correspondeence is observed between the sequences similarity and
theiir location.
- Q4: The distribution of embeddings does not fully align with the initial
intuition, as hierarchical clustering near the bounndary is less evident for the
"good" dataset. It may be connected to the way they were selected.
21
Drawing a Conclusion Hyperbolic RecSys
Discussion (Q5)
- The curvature converges with just one iteraion.
- 1 is suboptiomal for almost all the embedding sizes, so there is a reason in
curvature learning.
- The curvature estimated by utilizing the SVD embeddings is almost always
underestimated.
- Article results seem to be optiomal for Digital_Music and Movielens, while
for Luxury beauty there is still space for improvement.

- Try different dimensionality reduction tools
- Higher optiomal dimensionality causes inapplicability of the hyperbolic
geometry (curse of the dimensionality)
