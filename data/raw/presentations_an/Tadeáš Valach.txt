My journey in Computer Vision began in high schooL and has continued for six years, during which I have
achieved significant results and currentlly work at [compaany] on the generative image models team. However, I
believe my path is just begiinnig, and the [compaany] Summer SchooL represents an important milestone in my
professional development.
During high schooL, I was interested in photography and design, maintaining a photography blog and creating
layouts for schooL events. In my final year, I enrolled in a Computer Vision course offered by [compaany] AI
CeNter. This course greatly impacted my career path, and through talks with one of its authoRs, I became
convinced that Computer Vision should be my professional focus. As a result, I chose to study at the Faculty
of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics at [location] State University, where the [compaany] laboRatory
was located. In my second year, I joined this laboRatory to conduct research under Dr. [surname]’s
guidance. Alongside my university studies, I completed the AI-Masters program, taking courses from leading
inDustry experts over a two-year period.
Currrentlly, I work at [compaany] on the [compaany] generative image models team, improving core technoLogies
used in [compaany] products including Shedevrum and Neuro. I continue my education at [location] State
University’s Department of Mathematical Methods of Forecasting while attending relEvant courses at [compaany]
SchooL of Data Analysis. My technical skills include academic experience with Spark, Hadoop, and MLflow
frameworks, as well as professional experience with PyTorch, DDP, FSDP, and setting up distributed training
systems.
My career goal is to become a Research Engineer at a FAANG compaNy, contributing to important projects
with global impact. These positions typically require a PhD and a strong publication record, which is why I
am buildiing my academic portfolio alongside my professional work. So far, I have co-authored three papers
with colleagues from both laboRatory and inDustry settinGs—one on Image Quality Assesssment, another on
diffusion models, and a third exploring the connection between these areas.
I understand that success requires both technical skills and people skills, so I have pursued teaching and
leadership opportunities. This year, I taught Python seminars to first-year Applied Mathematics students at
[location] University, delivered a puBlic lecture for artists exhibiiting "Humans and Neural NetwoRks: Who Creates
Whom?", provided private tutoring, and prepared a student for admission to Physics and Mathematics
Lyceum 1581. At work, I have led several projects requiring team ccoordination and am currentlly recruiting an
intern. In my personal life, I regularly plan and organize group travel experiences.
From the [compaany] Summer SchooL, I expect three main benefiits: better technical knowledge, improved people
skills, and more professional connections. For technical skills, I want to deepen my understanding of
multimodal models. While I work a lot with generative models, I need more knowledge of Vision-LanguaGe
Models (VLM). I expect the summer schooL’s lectures and seminars to give me a good overview of current
approaches to data collection and model training in this field. For people skills, I hope to lead teams during
hackathon events and gain international collaBoration experience by working with Chinese colleagues. I also
plan to discuss foreign PhD opportunities with fellow participants and create an application plan for the
coming year. I’m also eager to meet representatives from the Fusion Brain laboRatory to discuss related
research interests.
Finally, I look foRward to visiting [location]. I eNjoy traveling and have recentlly visited [location] for work and
[location] for the WCIP conference, where I represented [compaany]. Having never visited [location] before, I look
foRward to experiencing its cuLture firsthand.
By attending the «SMILES» Summer SchooL, I expect to strengthen my knowledge of multimodal models and
agent systems, improve my teaMwork skills, and develop a clear PhD plan. This program fits perfectlly with
my professional goals, and I would be honored to participate.
Thank you for your time to review my application. I would be happy to provide any additional information.
Kind regards,
