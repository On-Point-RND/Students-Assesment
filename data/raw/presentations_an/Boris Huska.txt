Summary
Multiple Myeloma Treatment Analyzer research is focused on
effectiveness of possible treatment options for patients with
Multiple Myeloma based on a statistical analysis of historical
data from real clinical practice in treating patients from [location].
The research was organized under sponsorship of [compaany] in 2020 under my supervision.
The AI-modelling based on RWD compared with literature analyses to get cross-validated results presented via a
single interface.
The aim of modelling:
• For the various combination of inputs (patient parameters)
calculate predicted outcomes (TTNT: time to the next
treatment, TTD: time to death) for all in-scope regimens to
compare their relative effectiveness.

Problem
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a complex and challenging cancer to treat:
Heterogeneity High Relapse Rates
Treatments that work for one Even after successful initial treatment, residual
patient may fail for another. "minimal residual disease" (MRD) often
persists, leading to relapse.
Marrow Microenvironment Limited Biomarkers
This microenvironment fosters drug MM lacks universally reliable biomarkers for early
resistance and immune evasion detection, prognosis, and treatment response
prediction.
Immune Evasion Toxic Side Effects
MM suppresses the immune Many therapies (e.g., CAR-T cells, bispecific
system by disabling T cells and antibodies) cause severe side effects (e.g.,
natural killer cells. cytokine release syndrome), limiting their use.

Why AI and modeling
Precision Diagnosis & Cox Regression
Subtyping
AI can analyze genomic, transcriptomic,
and proteomic data to identify distinct MM
subtypes, enabling tailored therapies.
Random Forest
Predicting Treatment
Response
Boosted trees
AI mines electronic health records (EHRs)
to uncover patterns in treatment
outcomes across diverse populations.
Reducing Toxicity
AI models predict which patients are at
risk for severe side effects (e.g.,
neurotoxicity from CAR-T), enabling
preemptive interventions.

Next steps and how SMILE2025
Steps:
• I plan to test neural networks to analyze patient response data (e.g.,
genetic markers, treatment histories) and recommend optimal drug
sequences.
• Additional focus on interpretable AI aligns with my goal to avoid "black-
box" solution which I’ve got with current modeling approach.
SMILE2025:
• The summer school’s hackathons or group projects could serve as a
"proof of concept" for my framework, leveraging peer feedback to refine it.
• Partnerships with attendees from medical backgrounds could help ground
my models in real clinical constraints (e.g., toxicity thresholds, cost-
effectiveness).
