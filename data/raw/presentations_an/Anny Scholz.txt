GOALS TASKS
• Study methods of communication with crows
Create ways for humans and crows to interact • Determine a method for training crows
• Conduct an experiment based on this method
and evaluate results
• Develop a method to train crows to collect
different items
• Learn image analysis using a neural network
• Train crows to collect cigarette butts
