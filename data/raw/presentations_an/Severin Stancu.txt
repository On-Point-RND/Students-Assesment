Introduction
Numerical integration of an unstable system of nonlinear differential equations
using classical iterative methods such as Runge-Kutta is a rather
resource-intensive task. A promising approach to solve this problem is the use
of neural networks to approximate the nonlinear operators of the ODE
solution. In this work we show the application of neural network of DeepONet
architecture on the example of the problem of findiing geodesics in the
gravitational field of a rotating black hole. Accuracy sufficient for constructing
model images of black hole shadows was achieved at a higher speed of
operation.

Results
rk8pd DeepONet
Figure: A neural network trained on a dataset with black holes in value 0.8 and the classical
method were used to calculate photon trajectories emitted from each screen pixel. To simulate the
problem a ring was
placed:
rin<x2+y2<rout (7)
For each emitted ray, the affine parameter λ was found with which the ray
intersects the ring. The figure shows images of the ring obtained by both methods. The
color in the figure represents the values of λ at which the intersection occurs.

Conclusion
Code has been developed implementing a nonlinear neural operator based
on the DeepONet architecture for solving systems of ODEs. This method
provides an alternative to iterative approaches and enables trajectory
computaion at any predefined point.
The DeepONet architecture neural network is applicable for solving
geodesic computaion problems with sufficient accuracy for image
construction while offering higher computaional speed.
Future work will focus on applying the neural operator to more complex
models, particularly - magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equaions
describing plasma behavior near black holes.
