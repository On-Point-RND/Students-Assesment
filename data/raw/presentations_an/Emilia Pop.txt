Mechanical properties
Mechanical parameters
were chosen as
predicted properties of
the co-crystal because
they determine plasticity
of the co-crystal

Validation case studies
Among the coformeers that
were generated for
Nicorandil, Rivaroxaban,
and Paracetamol, there
were some that were able
to form real co-crystals
with improved tabletability
properties validated in the
literature

were selected based on two tabletability parameters (Unobstructed planes, H-bond bridging) and

Current work

tnerruC
Current work includes adding a module to the GEMCODE to predict the optiomal co-crystal synthesis after molecular pair
has been determined.
The development of the module includes the stages of automatic data extraction and the creation of a predictive
system. Both stages are based on the application of LLM.
