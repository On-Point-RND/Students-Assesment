Introduction
• Topic: Targeted Sentiment Analysis
• Importance: detecting not only the sentiment of the whole sentence but also
towaards a particular target is an important task in certain domains (e.g. media)
• Goal of the review: validate the approach introduced in the paper on different data
Problem statement
Models fine-tuned on the Sentiment Analysis task may fail to detect the correct sentiment
considering a particular entity
The authors aim to help the model understand
where the target is located in a sentence
Original Methods & Results
• Authors’ approach: insertiing special [TAR] tags in the data right before and after the target.
Experimenting with different embeddings ([CLS] vs [TAR])
Reprroduction
• Dataset: RuSentNE
• Models (rubert-tiny2):
○ Baseline (no [TAR], [CLS])
○ tar_cls_model (input with [TAR], [CLS])
○ tar_tar_model (input with [TAR], 1st [TAR])
• Metrics used: F1 macro, accuracy
Reprroduction Results

Research gap
• What’s missing? Sentence-level SA labels
• Unresolved challenges: some classes and entities are consistently worse classified
• Future opportunities: focus on TSA vs SA comparison, optimal hyperparameters
