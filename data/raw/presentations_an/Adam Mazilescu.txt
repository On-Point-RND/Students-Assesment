Introduction
• Transcription factors (TF) are regulatory proteins
that control the rate of transcription by binding to
short sections of DNA called transcription factor
binding sites (TFBS).
• The task of detecting TFBS is one of the most
important task of modern bioinformatics.
• The detection of TFBS is essential for
understanding transcription regulation in cells.
• For example, the HOCOMOCCO database
contains 1,120 TF whose motifs are known[1], but
there are about 1,600 in total [2].

Introduction
TFBS Search Methods
An experimental approach The computer approach
• ChIP-seq • Based on alignment
(CONSENSUS)
• TF-SELEX • Based on probabilistic
models (BaMMotif)
• Electrophoretic mobility • Based on SVM (Kmer-
shift assay (EMSA) SVM)
• Based on deep learning
• DNase footprinting (DeeperBind)
They are based only on the nucleotide
sequence and do not take TF information.
