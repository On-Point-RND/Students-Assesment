It has been establiished that the planktonic community produces up to 50% of all oxygen
in the Earth's atmosphere.

The purpose of the work
1) To conduct a study of the time series of the plankton community based on chaos
theory.
2) Identification of the best model for predicting the volume of the plankton community
in the future (Holt-Winters model, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMAX, LSTM).
3) To identify the relationship between different types of plankton and to build food
relationships between different species of the plankton community of [location].
4) To study the mathematical model of the pelagic community of the Lake [location]
ecosystem.

Conclusion of the work
1) A study of the time series of the plankton community based on chaos theory has been
conducted.
2) The volume of the plankton community was predicted for 24 and 53 weeks ahead for
the two plankton species under consideration and a model was identified that gives a
minimum error in forecasting for each plankton species under consideration.
3) Correlaations between different types of plankton are revealed and the nutritional
relationships between different species of the Lake [location] plankton community are
consideered.
4) A mathematical model of the pelagic community of the Lake [location] ecosystem is
consideered.
