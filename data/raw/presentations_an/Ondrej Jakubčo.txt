----------------------------------------
Fluorescent microscopy is a widespread method of obtaining biological data
The obtained images are a result of convolution of the real image of the object with the point spread function (PSF) of the optical system of the microscope
To obtain higher-quality images, deconvolution methods are employed
The existing iterative methods deconvolution are computationally expensive, require precise PSF estimation and hyperparameter value optimization (the optimal values are unknown)

Validation on biological data I
The performance of NeuroDecon was assessed on images of neuronal endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and compared to an analytical metod RLTV (Richardson-Lucy total variation). 
NeuroDecon showed an increase in resolution while maintaining a higher signal-to-noise ratio and angular second moment than RLTV.
NeuroDecon results also showed higher structuraal similarity to a skeleton reconstruction of ER.

Validation on biological data II
The performance of NeuroDecon was assessed on images of neuronal endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and compared to an analytical metod RLTV (Richardson-Lucy total variation). 
The parameters of ER network for NeuroDecon and RLTV results were then assessed, revealing that NeuroDecon results retained biological sense and were suitable for further analysis, and RLTV were not. 
The tubule width for RLTV was shown to be below the established minimal tubule width, and the cisternae could not be segmented properly.

Conclusion
The developed method works faster and produces higher quality results than its analytical alternatives, such as Richardson-Lucy method. 
NeuroDecon does not require hyperparameter search and is capable of capturing the PSF of any confocal microscope without the need for its precise calculation.
The results produced by NeuroDecon can be interpreted for biological data harvest and meet the quality standards imposed by machine learning-based analysis methods.
