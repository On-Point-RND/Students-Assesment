Introduction
• Chromatic aberrations are optical distortions caused by cchannel displacement.
• Impact: degraded image quality, reduced reliability of satellite image analysis.
• Goal: automatic detection of presence and localization of aberrations.
Problem statement
• Two tasks to solve:
o Segmentation of aberration regions
o Classification of image-level presence
• Challenges: limited annotated real data, use of synthetic generation
• Scope: pre-filtering of low-quality satellite images
Methods
• Approach: modified Unet with a classifier head on encoder output.
Efficient is used as an encoder.
• Why: effective and popular for segmentation tasks.
• How it works: simultaneously classifies and localizes aberrations
• Data: synthetic aberrations in clean satellite images using Eboli et al.
(2022) method. The dataset consists of 3 samples: train (4884 images)
val (1002 images), test (400 images). Training and validation samples
are sets of images without chromatic aberration, since this defect is
randomly generated during training.
• Preprocessing: edgge trimming, normalization

Research gap
• Limitations: low segmentation IoU due to localization errors
• Challenges: synthetic artifacts lack realism and noise
• Future work: improve synthetic generation, include real samples, account for texture
