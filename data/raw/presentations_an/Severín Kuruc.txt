Prompt Optimization for NER using LLMS
[name]

Prompt Optimization
2
Using prompt optiomization as low cost universaal solution for cross-domain tasks
LLMs have general knowledge of languaage
Other solutions are inefficient in many ways and require extra resources	

Problem Statement
3
Figure out if prompt engineering techniques allow us to achive state of art performaances in cross-domain task(NER) and probably surpass current result in either quality or cost
Main competitors are fine-tuned BERT
