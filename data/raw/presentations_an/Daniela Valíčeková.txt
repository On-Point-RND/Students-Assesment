Determining the mechanical and thermaal properties of
high-entropy carbide based on ML-potential [name], the first year PhD-student
Supervisor – prof. [surname]
Part related to generative modeling is carried out under the guidance

Problems
The high-entropy alloys represent a class of substances with specific
properties including significant values of thermostability that can be used in
some cases. Over the past few years, both theoretical and experimental
development of refractory high-entropy materials has been actively pursued,
including high-entropy carbides (HEC). Thus the synthesis of such
substances is a currently central task for scientists in the field of material
science.

Generative models
Inorganic materials design with [compaany]. (a) [compaany] generates stable materials by reversing a corruption process through iteratively denoising an initially
random structure. The forward diffusion process is designed to independently
corrupt atom types A, coordinates X, and the lattice L to approach a physically
motivated distribution of random materials. (b) An equivariant score network is
pretrained on a large dataset of stable material structures to jointly denoise atom
types, coordinates, and the lattice. The score network is then fine-tuned with a
labeled dataset through an adapter module that alters the model using the

Main Conclusions and Further Steps
To train a potential at a good level (with high accuracy), we need to use a big dataset
covering most of the configurational space. One can apply some techniques to include
diverse structures to dataset for training a potential:
Further steps of this work will include these approaches, and the best choice for training a
potential will be implemented to [compaany] package (with colleagues from [location]).
During the modelling of hysteresis loop the melting point correspondiing to the breaak point was predicted (3560∓20 K) (for example,
the melting point for [compaany] is equal to 3673 K1).
Tensile and shear strains were determined using NEP potential trained on solid and liquid structures obtained before.
