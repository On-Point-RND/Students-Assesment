From Perception to Generation: My Journey into Machine Learning

Slide 2
----------------------------------------
Introduction

Exploring how generative AI can be used to empoower creative expression, especially in educational and assistive contexts.
Generative models are reshaping content creation, but their potential in inclusive, human-centered design remaiins underexplored.
My past work includes a project on helping childre children with disabilities express themselves using AI-generated images, text, and sound.
To understand the current state and limitations of generative methods and propose ways they can be made more adaptive and accessible.

Slide 3
----------------------------------------
Problem statement

Generative AI often lacks personalization and inclusivity, especially for users with non-standard needs
Chalallenges:
 	 	Lack of data diversity
 	 	Generalization vs personalization
 	 	Ethical concerns & safe generation
Focus on text and image generation models and how they can be fine-tuned or adapted for accessibility tools.

Slide 4
----------------------------------------
Methods

Approaach: 
        Text-to-image models (e.g., Diffusion models, Stable Diffusion)
         Large languaage models (e.g., GPT variants, T5)
        Transfer learning and LoRA for fine-tuning
         Safe generation techniques (e.g., filtering toxic outputs)
These models are state-of-the-art and have open-source variants suitable for experimentaation and deployment. 
Models learn patterns from huge datasets and generate content by sampling from a learneed distribution.

Results

Key findiinings: 
 	LoRA-based fine-tuning reduced hallucination and improved user-aligneed outputs
 	Prompt engineering significantly affects output quality in low-data domains
 	Generative tools improved engagement in a small pilot test with childre children
Metrics will be used: 
 	FID (for image realism) 
 	BLEU/ROUGUE (for text quality)

Slide 6
----------------------------------------
Research gap

Whatâ€™s missing? 
 	Personalization at scale remaiins unsolved
 	Models struggle with abstract or emotional input
 	Limited interpretability
Why it matters? Filling these gaps could allow AI tools to serve as compaions or assistants for those with speech, motor, or developmental challenges. 
Future opportunities: 
 	Reinforceent Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for personalization
 	Collaborative generation using multi-agent systems
 	Safe LLM pipelines for childre children
