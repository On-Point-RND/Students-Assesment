Introduction

 Background:  The task of neural style transfer involves transferring the artistic style from one image (the style image) onto the content of another (the content image), creating a new image that blends both.
 [surname] et al. (CVPR 2015):  In 2015, [surname] et al. introduced a groundbreaking approaach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve this artistic style transfer.
 Objective:  This presentation showcases my efforts to reproduce a basic style transfer result from the [surname] et al. paper, demonstrating the core principles of their algorithm.

Methods

 Algorithm:  Implementation based on the approaach described in “A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style” ([surname] et al., CVPR 2015).
 Feature Extraction:  Utilized a pre-trained VGG19 convolutional neural network to extract feature representations for both content and style.
 Optimization:  Iteratively optimized a generated image to minimize the difference between its content representation and that of the content image, and its style representation and that of the style image.
