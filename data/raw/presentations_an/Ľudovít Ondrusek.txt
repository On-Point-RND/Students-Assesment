Explanatoory and
dependent variable
The dependent variable - wheat yield
Explanatoory variables:
- The fact of precipiitaion (binary variable)
- The fact of fertiilization (binary variable)
- Atmospheric pressure (instrumental variable)
- The amount of solar energy
- Air temperature

Data generation process
To train the models, the generated data was distributed between
the training and test samples as 80% and 20%, respectiively
