## NCP-DPOC: Direct Preference Optimization for Diffusion Models

This document summarizes the research paper "NCP-DPOC: Direct Preference Optimization for Diffusion Models," outlining the problem, proposed solution, experimental setup, results, and references.

**Problem:**

While Direct Preference Optimization (DPOC) has shown success in aligning large language models with human preferences, applying it directly to diffusion models (like Stable Diffusion) presents challenges. The standard DPOC approach relies on comparing two generated images and selecting the preferred one, which can be computationally expensive and may not effectively guide the diffusion process.

**Proposed Solution: NCP-DPOC**

The authors propose **NCP-DPOC (Non-Contrastive Preference Optimization with Perceptual Loss)**, a novel approach to adapt DPOC for diffusion models. The key idea is to incorporate a **perceptual loss** into the DPOC framework. This loss encourages the generated images to be similar to the preferred image from the preference pairs, guiding the diffusion process more effectively than solely relying on the preference signal.

**How NCP-DPOC Works:**

1. **Preference Pairs:** The method utilizes preference pairs of images generated from a prompt. Humans (or potentially other preference models) indicate which image is preferred.
2. **Perceptual Loss:** A perceptual loss is calculated between the generated image and the preferred image. This loss is based on the features extracted from the intermediate denoising steps of the diffusion process using a pre-trained U-Net.
3. **DPOC Optimization:** The DPOC algorithm is then applied, incorporating the perceptual loss term into the loss function. This allows the model to learn to generate images that are not only preferred but also perceptually similar to the preferred example.

**Experimental Setup:**

* **Models:** The researchers evaluated NCP-DPOC on two popular diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL).
* **Dataset:** They used the Standard Pick-a-Pic dataset, a publicly available dataset of human preferences for text-to-image generation.
* **LoRA:** Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with rank-64 was used for efficient fine-tuning.
* **Metrics:** Both automatic metrics (PickScore, HPSv2, ImageReward, Aesthetic Score, CLIP score) and human preference studies were employed to evaluate the performance of NCP-DPOC.

**Experimental Results:**

The results demonstrate that NCP-DPOC consistently outperforms standard DPOC on both Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL across various automatic metrics and in human preference studies.

* **Automatic Metrics:** NCP-DPOC achieved significantly higher scores on most automatic metrics compared to DPOC, indicating improved image quality and alignment with human preferences.
* **Human Preference Studies:** Human evaluators consistently preferred images generated by NCP-DPOC over those generated by DPOC, especially for more complex prompts.
* **Examples:** The paper includes visually compelling examples showcasing the improved image quality and preference alignment achieved by NCP-DPOC.

**Key Findings:**

* Incorporating a perceptual loss significantly enhances the effectiveness of DPOC for diffusion models.
* NCP-DPOC leads to improved image quality, better alignment with human preferences, and higher scores on various automatic metrics.
* The method is effective for both Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL.
