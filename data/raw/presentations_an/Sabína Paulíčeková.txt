Introduction
• A Health Index (HI) is a single,
continuous numerical value that
summarizes the overall
condiition or degradation level of
a system over time.
Why do we need it?
• Early Fault Detection
• Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction:
• Interpretability
Problem statement
We are given multivariaate time-series ( sensor readings)
We want to get scalar value hi, 0 ≤ hi ≤ 1
Applicability estimation: prediction of RUL (remaining useful life)
Methods
• We train autoencoder models on the first 20 % the time series sequences with
reconstruction loss.
• Using the train representations, we calculate the mean healthy vector in latent space, and to
estimate the HI for every device state, we use the cosine similarity between that sample
representation and the mean healthy state vector.
• We used the [compaany] CMAPSS fd001 dataset.
Applicability estimation
• To prove the applicability of cosine similarity HI in state description,
we tried to predict RUL based on the similarity approach [name] et al. (2016). This approach is
based on identifying close regions between training and test health index curves. The algorithm
finds the top 5 close regions of the curves with the test sample and averages their RUL values to
obtain the prediction. Focused on early degradation data (RUL > 140)
• We compaare them with true values by RMSE metric,

Research gap
• Applicability to new datasets
• Improving matching technique (deep
learning based) in RUL estimation
• Additional experiments with SOTA
architectures
• Investigation of limitations of
hyperparameter sensitivity (e.g., available
sequence length)
