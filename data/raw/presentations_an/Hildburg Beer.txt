CRRG-CLIP: Automatic Generation of Chest
Radiology Reports and Classification of Chest
Radiographs

https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01989
The main idea
● Massive number of radiographs make writing radiology reports complex
and inefficient
● Even highly experienced radiologists struggle to maintain accuracy and
consistency under prolonged high-intensity work
● Multi-modal models have evolved significantly

Methods. Data
MIMIC-CXR: only report section from reports was taken
MIMIC-CXR-JPG: images in JPG
Chest ImaGenome: bounding boxes and reports (based on MIMIC-CXR)
RSNA Pneumonia: images, labels, metadata

Conclusion
● Multi-modal models performs really great, but there are some doubts about this
pipeline
● Extracting only special regions to use further in predictions can increase accuracy
● CLIP-based approaches are popular
