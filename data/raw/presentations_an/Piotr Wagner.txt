Introduction

The tasks of Earth surface classification using remotely sensed data are quite often solved using machine learning algorithm. Machine learning methods are based on the detection of statistical regularities of the training sample, so they require careful selection of data for training. To avoid overtraining of models, it is necessary to select the optimal amount of input data, which is often a non-trivial task. And, if the task requires the use of big data, it may require large computational resources to use it. Thus, the task of obtaining a machine learning model is reduced to processing a large data set and selecting a representative sample for training the model.

Problem statement

There is no open access map of agricultural crops in [location] which is essential for harvest forecasting
There is no open crop data for [location] that can be used as a training sample
The aim of this investigation to make an algorithm that will detect the crops on the base of satellite imagery

Solving the problem with the lack of training data: make a dataset using crop data from the datasets all over the world

Methods

Approach: for task of classification we used algorithm of gradient boosting (Catboost).
Similar works use classical classification methods such as decision trees, random forest, k-means, etc. 
Gradient boosting is a method that resistant to retraining, 
Data & preprocessing: 
Extraction of point data from map information 
Extraction time-series of vegetation index (WRDVI) using [compaany] API
Lowess-smoothing of input data and data approximation with double logistic function (to clean from noise highlightiing culture deviation only)
Filtration data on the base of curve form and R2
Calculating of phenological characteristics for features

Results

Key findiings: 
The algorithm of processing data is applied
Overall accuracy – 59%
The worser classificated classes - cereals
Metrics used: accuracy, precision, recall, F-score. Our aim – to make the map that can be used

Research gap

What’s missing? The sample we have – random choosing from big amount of data. Because of limitations of [compaany] Platform. We have no possibility to check all the data – it’s too long and resource-intensive
Unresolved challenges: the accuracy of our product is too small to use it on the territory of [location], because some crops is too difficult to divide on the base of satellite imagery
Why it matters? 
Future opportunities: 
To add some spatial or meteorological data to features
To try Neural networks for classification
