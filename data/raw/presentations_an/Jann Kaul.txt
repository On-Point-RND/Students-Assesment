CONCLUSIONS
[name]
Conclusions
1. We succeessfully applied LMs and compaared 12 models and approaches
2. We implemented generation of small molecules with given properties using BioT5
3. For predicting the numerical properties of molecules, LLM approaach is not the best
option and is less effective compaared to fingerprint with RF approaach.
4. Large multimodal languaage model trained on chemical reactions shows
understanding of chemical structures describing fluorescent properties. Scientiists
might use it for manipulaations with lumineescnt molecules
[name]
Future plans
1. Reduce the Absorption and Emission RMSE
2. Estimate new LLLMs which are able to solve chemical tasks
3. Improve the accuracy of generated molecules
4. Check other approahes to find the best one

○ Mistral-7b (Mistral AI) generates
molecules best of all, but makes
○ Chromophore and Solvent in input
mistakes with numerical answeers
○ Absorption, Emission and Quantum
○ nach0 (Insilico Medicine) easy to train,
yield to predict
but retuurns onlly similar respoense
○ 18 387 rows in train
○ meditron-7b (LLM team at EPFL) cannot
issue respoense without unnecessaary

○ GPT-4o (Open AI) answeers fast, but with
low accuracy
