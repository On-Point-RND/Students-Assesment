Note
Presented research has not yet been published thus the results section is very limited. While the main focus
of my scientific career was in the area of engineering, see my works at [compaany] scolar profile
(https://scholar.[compaany].com/citations?user=[name]&hl=en), this work is my first one in the area of
bioinformatics, which I believe is more related to the topic of the SMILE.

Introduction
• The idea of the research is to investigate the associations between consanguineous marriage and
deleterious recessiive alleles associated with congenital diseases
• This data has been obtained by many animal species, but never been demonstrated on humans. This
informaation will help to better understand human evolutionary dynamics, especially during the evolutional
bottlenecks. It will also help us to understand how different communities can be affected by the congenital
diseases, which will help to address their health risks.
Problem statement
• The work analyze the runs of homozygosity (ROH) in different human populations, and find the correlation
between them and the genetic markeers of congenital disease (like CADD score, or LoF score) and the
official data of congenital disease levels presented by the medical agencies for different populations.
• The main challenges in the amount of the data that need to be analyzed, as even the obtaining and RoH
from the whole genome sequence require significant amount of the computaional power. The work will be
performeed on a cluster of the [compaany] , provided by [compaany]
Methods
• Main methods will be PLINK (open-source whole genome association analysis tools) and BWA
and GATK algorithm to get the information about genetic sequence variations from the DNA
sequence
• Data & preprocessing will include quality controls (e.g. alignments to a reference genome)
statistical tests (e.g., chi-square, regression), and combination of variant calls across multiple
samples for consistency and improved accuracy
Results
• The results are expected to be published within this year
